            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE better to prepare the mind of my Reader for what I ſhall ſay in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about Infant-Baptiſm, I think it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to premiſe a ſhort Introduction.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Concerning the initiatory Sacrament into it, and the Perſons that were capable of Initiation.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, Concerning the alteration of it from the <hi>Moſaic</hi> into the <hi>Chriſtian Oeconomy,</hi> or to expreſs my ſelf more plainly in the <note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>As for the Original of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto <hi>Abraham</hi> the <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</note> 
               <hi>Father of the Faithful</hi> purely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Church. But if it be conſidered as a Common-wealth,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52302:3"/>
or as a Church under ſuch a Political Regulation, then it is to be referred unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was called, even by Heathen Writers, the <note n="*" place="margin">Dionyſ. Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <hi>Legiſlator</hi> of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Theſe two Conſiderations of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, <hi>purely as a Church,</hi> and as a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or as a Church under ſuch a mixture with a Common-wealth ought heedfully to be diſtinguiſhed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is ground for ſuch a diſtinction in the nature of the thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe this diſtinction is made by the Apoſtle, who was of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> an <hi>Hebrew</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and by conſequence very well qualified to underſtand the difference betwixt the <hi>Jewiſh Oeconomy</hi> as a Church, and as a Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, there is a Ground for ſuch a diſtinction in the Nature of the thing, as is evident to any Man, who is capable of conſidering the difference betwixt the Church-Chriſtian before, and after its Union with the Empire. Before its Union with the Empire, it ſubſiſted by it ſelf purely as a Church above three hundred years, in a State of Perſecution, from Chriſt unto <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; and juſt ſo the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church for above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſubſiſted by it ſelf in a State of Peregrination and Captivity from <hi>Abraham</hi> unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> who brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and gave them the Law.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, As there is ground for this diſtinction in the nature of the thing, ſo is it in effect made by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This I ſay, that the Covenant that was before confirmed of God</hi> [with <hi>Abraham] in Chriſt, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe</hi> [to <hi>Abraham] of none Effect.</hi> Here is a plain difference made between the Covenant or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, when he ſeparated him from the World unto himſelf, and that <hi>Political</hi> one, which he afterwards made with the <hi>Jews,</hi> when he gave them the Law: And this difference is alſo obſerved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.13. <hi>The Promiſe, that he ſhould be the Heir of the World, was not given to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or to his Seed through the Law, but through the Righteouſneſs of Faith: For
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52302:3"/>
if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe is of no effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe words, which diſtinguiſh ſo plainly between the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Promiſe, which he made unto him, and the <hi>Law,</hi> it is evident that the beginning of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church purely conſidered, as a Church, is to be dated from the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, the way to find out the nature of the <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical,</hi> or pure <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, is to conſider the nature of the Covenant, or Promiſe upon which it was founded; and if we examine the Scriptures, we ſhall find, that it was an <hi>Evangelical Covenant:</hi> For ſubſtance the ſame with that which is ſince made betwixt God and us through Chriſt. This will appear upon a Review of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which teach us, <hi>That Faith was the Condition of this</hi> Abrahamical <hi>Covenant; that it was made with</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe ſpeaketh the Apoſtle in the Fourth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> from the 9th. to the 15th. Verſe: Cometh then this Bleſſedneſs [of <hi>Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith</hi>] upon the Circumciſion only, or upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion alſo? For we ſay, that Faith was reckoned to <hi>Abraham</hi> for Righteouſneſs; how was it then reckon'd? When he was in Circumciſion, or in Uncircumciſion? Not in Circumciſion, but in Uncircumciſion; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sign of Circumciſion a Seal of <hi>(the Promiſes made to)</hi> the Righteouſneſs of Faith, which he had being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52302:4"/>
yet uncircumciſed that <hi>[ſo believing before Circumciſion]</hi> he might be the Father <hi>(both)</hi> of all them that believe, tho' they be not circumciſed, that righteouſneſs might be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them alſo <hi>(as his Children)</hi> and the Father of Circumciſion to them, who are not of the Circumciſion only, but <hi>(who)</hi> alſo walk in the Steps of that Faith of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he had, being yet uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; for the Promiſe that he ſhould be the Heir of the World <hi>(in his Poſterity)</hi> was not to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or his Seed, through <hi>(the Righteouſneſs of)</hi> the Law; but through the Righteouſneſs <hi>(which cometh)</hi> of Faith: For if they <hi>[only]</hi> which are of the Law be Heirs, <hi>(his)</hi> Faith (<hi>ſo much celebrated</hi> is made void, and the Promiſe made <hi>(to it)</hi> of no effect. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. from the 5th to the 10th Verſe: He therefore that miniſtreth unto you the <hi>(extraordinary Gifts of the)</hi> Spirit, and worketh Miracles among you; doth he it by the works of the Law, or by the Faith, which you have heard preached, even as <hi>(it is written of)</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Quoniam autem &amp; in <hi>Abraham</hi> prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurabatur fides noſtra, &amp; quoniam Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcha no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae fidei, &amp; velut prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta fuit, pleniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimè Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus docuit in eâ Epiſtolâ, quae eſt ad <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latas</hi> dicens, <hi>Qui ergo tribuit vobis Spiritum &amp; operatur virtutes in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis</hi> — Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus Lib. 4. cap. 38.</note> 
               <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, (he)</hi> believed God, and it was imputed unto him for Righteouſneſs; know ye therefore, that they which are <hi>(the Children)</hi> of Faith, the ſame are the Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and God in the Scripture foreſeeing that he would juſtifie the Heathen through Faith preached before the Goſpel unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi> So then they which be <hi>(the Children)</hi> of Faith, are bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham who is the Father of them that believe.</hi> Afterwards in Verſe 26. Now to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or his Seed, <hi>or Race</hi> were the Promiſes <hi>[of God]</hi> made: He, (<hi>i. e.</hi> God, or <hi>Moſes</hi> his Pen-man) ſaith, <hi>Not to Seeds, or Races,</hi> as if there were divers of them; but to thy Seed, <hi>i. e.</hi> to one of thy Seed, which is Chriſt. And this I ſay, that the <hi>(Abrahamical)</hi> Covenant that was before confirmed by God in Chriſt, the Law, which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot diſannul, that it ſhould make the Promiſe (<hi>made unto</hi> Abraham) of none effect.</p>
            <p>From all theſe Texts put together, it is plain, that the <hi>Abrahamical</hi> Covenant, upon which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, as ſuch, was founded, was of a Spiritual, Evangelical Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52302:4"/>
and perfectly verified and fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt, who was made of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and in whom all the Families of the Earth are bleſſed, and whoſe Day <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf ſaw, and rejoyced. It is farther evident from them, that this Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the Father of Believers, and with his Poſterity, not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from him by natural, but by ſpiritual Generation, as Heirs of his Faith, as is plain from <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>(the Promiſe)</hi> is of Faith, that ſo alſo it might be by Grace; to the end the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed (of <hi>Abraham</hi>) not to that only, which is of the Law; but to that alſo which is of the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is the Father of us all, <hi>both Jew and Gentile, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> So Chap. 9.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not as tho' the Word or Promiſe of God to them had taken none effect: For they are not all <hi>(the) Iſrael</hi> which are deſcended of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are they all Children <hi>(of God's Covenant)</hi> but ('tis ſaid) in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy Seed be called; [<hi>tho'</hi> Abraham <hi>had more Sons</hi>] that is <hi>(all)</hi> they which are the Children of the Fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God; but the Children of the Promiſe (only as <hi>Iſaac</hi> was) are counted for the Seed.</p>
            <p>Hence ſaith the Apoſtle in the name of the Chriſtians,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3.</note> we are the Circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and have no Confidence in the Fleſh, and it is one God which ſhall juſtifie the Circumciſion by Faith, and the Uncircumciſion through Faith; and if ye be Chriſt's, then are ye <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and Heirs, according to the Promiſe, <hi>which God made unto</hi> Abraham.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, that this Covenant was Evangelical, and made with the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not as his Natural, but as his Spiritual Off-ſpring, will appear in the third place from the initiatory Sacrament into it, which was <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> or cutting off the Fore-skin of the Fleſh; as it is written, <hi>You ſhall Circumciſe the Fore-skin of your Fleſh, and it ſhall be a Sign of the Covenant betwixt me and you.</hi> Hence the Covenant of which it was the Sign, is called by <note n="*" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>As to the Perſons who were capable of initiation into the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church by this Sacrament, we have a very plain account at the inſtitution of it in <hi>Gen.</hi> Chap. 27. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith God unto <hi>Abraham) eſtabliſh my Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Me, and thee, and thy Seed after thee for an Everlaſting Covenant to be a God unto thee, and thy Seed after thee — Thou ſhalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and thy Seed after thee in their Generations; this is</hi> [The Token of] <hi>my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which ye ſhall keep between Me and you, and thy Seed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee, every Male among you ſhall be Circumciſed. And ye ſhall Circumciſe the fleſh of your Fore-skin, and it ſhall be a Token of the Covenant betwixt Me and you, and he that is eight days old ſhall be Circumciſed among you, every Male in your Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he that is born in the Houſe, or bought with Money of any Stranger, which is not of thy Seed, he that is born in thy Houſe, and he that is bought with thy Money muſt needs be Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and my Covenant ſhall be in your fleſh for an everlaſting Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this account of Perſons to be Circumciſed, it is plain,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52302:5"/>Firſt, That <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were born of <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod</hi> 12.48, 49.</note> Gentile Parents in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, or bought with his Money, as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants then were, and <hi>Blacks</hi> are now among us, were to be initiated into the Covenant by Circumciſion, from whence it appears, that the Spiritual Race of <hi>Abraham</hi> were the Children of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that when God promiſed to be a God to him, and his Seed after him, he meant the Children of his Faith. Hence in all Ages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, if any <hi>Gentiles</hi> embraced the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith and Religion, they were admitted into it by Circumciſion, and thereupon reckoned among the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the peculiar People of God, although they were not the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh. There were great numbers of <hi>Gentiles</hi> thus converted to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Faith and <hi>Religion,</hi> and grafted like wild Branches into the Olive-Tree, in all the Ages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. Not to mention particular Perſons, we read that many of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> became <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of <hi>Aſhuerus, Eſther</hi> 8.17. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Selden de jure</hi> l. 2. c. 2.</note> Likewiſe, in the time of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> vaſt numbers of the <hi>neighbouring Countries</hi> embraced <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> the whole Nation of the <hi>Idumaeans</hi> turned <hi>Jews,</hi> and lived in their own <hi>Country</hi> according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites. This ſhort <hi>account</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Proſelytes may ſatisfie any <hi>Man,</hi> who is not perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beyond cure, that the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was not founded upon, nor conſtituted by natural Generation, but by Spiritual Regeneration, as the Church Chriſtian is, and that thoſe, who were then related unto God, as Members of his Church were ſo, becauſe they were the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who then was and ſtill is the Father of the Church, and Church Members, to whom he is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not in his Natural, but in his Religious Capacity, as he was a Believer, and the Father of all thoſe that believe.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, It is manifeſt from this Scriptural account of perſons to be Circumciſed, that Circumciſion was an <hi>Ordinance of Latitude,</hi> comprehending Perſons of all Ages, and that Children, and Minors not yet arrived at years of Diſcretion, who were incapacitated, as to ſome ends of Circumciſion, were notwithſtanding to be ſolemnly initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52302:6"/>
by it, as well as grown Men, who were capable of all. God was pleaſed to call them his; nay, they were his Property, as much as their Parents of whom they deſcended, he looked upon them as holy and ſeparate, and as Candidates of the Covenant, and he thought them ſo well qualified for admiſſion into it, that he would not have it put off beyond the eighth day.</p>
            <p>He that is eight days old, or as it is in the Original, a Son of eight days, ſhall be circumcis'd among you. God was ſo far from excluding of them from Sacramental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiation upon the account of <hi>natural incapacity,</hi> that he limited the time for the adminiſtration of it, beyond which he would not have it deferr'd. And accordingly the <hi>Jews</hi> ever did moſt religiouſly obſerve it, from the time of <hi>Abraham</hi> unto the time of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and Chriſt, who were both Circumciſed the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1.59.2.21.</note> eighth day. Nay when any <hi>Gentile</hi> turned <hi>Jew,</hi> they immediately Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Children if he deſired it; always underſtanding that Children were called and elected by God in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Thus ſaith God unto <hi>Abraham, I will eſtabliſh my Covenant between thee and me, and thy Seed after thee for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and thy Seed after thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Goodneſs of God made him thus ſeparate the Children with their Parents from the reſt of the World, and look upon them as part of his choſen peculiar People, by which they became relatively Holy, and of a religious Conſideration, and differed from the Children of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as much as their Parents did from the Unbelievers themſelves. Since therefore God was pleaſed to be ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious as to chooſe the Children with their Parents, and look upon them as Holy upon their account, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that he ſhould oblige them to dedicate, and devote them betimes unto him, by ſolemn initiation into his Church. I ſay, he called and elected them in their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and with them ſeparated them unto himſelf from the World, and, agreeably to the nature of this Gracious Call, and ſeparation, he made it a ſufficient qualification for their actual admiſſion into the Church, by the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52302:6"/>
Ordinance, which the Children of Heathens were not capable of, becauſe they were not ſo called, and choſen, and ſeparated of God.</p>
            <p>This was ground enough for their admiſſion into the Church, and for God to look upon them, as Believers, though they could not make open Profeſſion of their Faith, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did before he was Baptized, and it is certain, after the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> all <note n="*" place="margin">Selden de Synedr. l. 2. c. 3.</note> adult Proſelytes did. But though <hi>Abraham</hi> profeſſed his Faith before he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, <hi>Iſaac</hi> the next Heir of the Promiſe was Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed before he profeſſed, or could profeſs his Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he lived he was as ſure to profeſs it by vertue of his Calling, and Election as any adult Proſelyte was to continue in the Profeſſion of his.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Faith and Conſent of the Father, or, if the Child had none, of the Suſceptor or God-father,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 2.46.</note> and of the <hi>Congregation</hi> under which he was Circumciſed, was believed of old by the <hi>Jews</hi> to be <note n="†" place="margin">Seld. de iure lib <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>2.</hi> de Synedr. l. <hi>1.</hi> c <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> imputed to the Child, as his own Faith and Conſent. They had very good ground in the Scriptures for this Opinion, becauſe the Infidelity and Diſobedience of the Parents, in wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, or deſpiſing Circumciſion, was imputed to the Children, who were eſteemed and puniſhed as Breakers of the Covenant, when they were not circumciſed, as it is written, <hi>Every uncircumciſed Male, whoſe Fleſh of his Foreskin is not circumciſed, that Soul ſhall be cut off from his People; he hath broken my Covenant;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſſand. de Baptiſm.

Thus in <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.28. we find the keeping of the Sanctuary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Males of the <hi>Cohathites</hi> of a month old and upwards, becauſe their Fathers actually kept it, and they were to be trained up unto it; and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11, 12. the <hi>little ones</hi> are expreſly ſaid to enter into Covenant with God, becauſe the Men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did ſo; and thus alſo our Bleſſed Lord, who took upon him the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> although he healed <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>Having now briefly diſcourſed of the Original, and Evangelical Nature of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and the Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrament of it, and the perſons that were initiated thereinto, I now proceed to make a few Obſervations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Alteration of it, from the <hi>Moſaical</hi> into the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> or from the Legal State of it under the Old Teſtament, into the Evangelical under the New.</p>
            <p>For as it was the ſame for Subſtance under the Law that it was before it; ſo it ſtill remains the ſame for Subſtance under the Goſpel, that it was under the Law. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is the ſame, tho' the Superſtructure and Faſhion of the Houſe be very different. For <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſtill the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful; and we that believe under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are as much his Seed, and Children in God's prime Intention, and the true meaning of the Words, as thoſe that were Believers under the Law.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes to paſs, that the Church-Chriſtian is called in the New Teſtament, the New and Supernal <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> to let us know, that Chriſtianity is nothing but Spiritual <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> the ſame City new reformed, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon a new Charter, bleſſed with more noble and ample Priviledges than formerly; and every way better built, and more Auguſt than it was. Thus in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Unto him that overcometh</hi> (ſaith the Son of Man) <hi>I will write the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is New</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which is come down out of Heaven, from my God:</hi> that is, I will acknowledge him that holds out to the end for a perſon truly godly, and for a true Member of the pure Catholick Chriſtian-Church, which is the Spiritual <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſcended from above. And ſo Chap. 21. 2. <hi>I ſaw the Holy City New</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>coming down from God, down out of Heaven prepared as a</hi> Bride, <hi>adorned for her</hi> Husband, meaning <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt. So in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>Jeruſalem which is from above,</hi> or the Supernal <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is [a] free [City] which is the Mother of us all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52302:7"/>Hence alſo it comes to paſs, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Epiſtle, calls the Chriſtians by thoſe proper Titles and Appellations which God gave unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> as unto his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, <hi>viz. a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar People;</hi> which muſt needs imply, that the Chriſtian Church is fundamentally, and radically the ſame with the ancient Church of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Accordingly St. <hi>Paul</hi> tho' he was the Doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet compared the calling of them to the engrafting of the wild Olive-Tree into the old Olive-Trees Stock. It ſome of the Branches (ſaith <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</note> he unto them) be broken off <hi>[through Unbelief]</hi> and thou being a wild Olive Branch, was grafted in amongſt them, and with them partakeſt of the Root and Fatneſs of the <hi>[Ancient]</hi> Olive-Tree, boaſt not againſt the Branches <hi>[ſo cut off]</hi> but if thou boaſt <hi>[remember that]</hi> thou beareſt not the Root, but the Root thee; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, If thou wert cut off from the Olive-Tree, which is wild by Nature, and wert grafted contrary to <hi>[thy wild]</hi> Nature into a good Olive-Tree, how much more ſhall theſe <hi>[unbelieving Jews]</hi> which be the natural Branches, be <hi>re-grafted</hi> into their own Olive-Tree? From this Compariſon it is plain, that the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church are the ſame in the Root and Stock: And from this radical Argument that is betwixt them, it proceeds, that St. <hi>John</hi> in his Symbolical way of Writing in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> calls the Chriſtians <hi>Jews: Behold I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan which ſay they are Jews but are not,</hi> Rev. 3.9.2.9. Indeed, as <hi>Judaiſm</hi> was nothing but myſtical Chriſtianity; ſo Chriſtianity is nothing but reformed <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> which made our Saviour, who was the Reformer of it, ſay unto the <hi>Jews, Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law, and the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to perfect and fulfil.</hi> And unto his Diſciples, who under him were to be Maſter-Builders of his Houſe, he ſaid, <hi>That a Scribe, or Doctor rightly inſtructed unto the Kingdom of God, was like a Man that is an Houſholder, who bringeth out of his Store-houſe things both new and old.</hi> Thereby ſhewing, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> obſerves,<note place="margin">L. 4. c. 21. &amp; 43.</note> that he muſt be a very skilful Scribe in the Old Teſtament, that was fit to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52302:8"/>
make a Workman of the new. The Old Teſtament and legal Oeconomy was to be his Magazine, and Storehouſe, out of which he was to fetch many ſerviceable pieces for the new Building; and accordingly our Saviour, tho' in reforming the Houſe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was fain to pull it down, that it might be enlarged, yet both he that began the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and his Apoſtles, who finiſhed it, like Men that were Houſe-holders, uſed much of the Old Timber and Materials, and conformed it too, as much as they could, after the manner of the old. <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm.</note> They introduced as much of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> into the Chriſtian Religion, as the nature of the Reformation would well bear, and adhered as much as they could to the old, both in the Matter and Form of the new <hi>Oeconomy;</hi> and laid by few <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, but ſuch as were fulfilled in Chriſt and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Antitype and Subſtance of them; or elſe ſuch as were inconſiſtent with the Nature of the Church-Chriſtian, as it was to be a manly, free, and univerſal Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the two reaſons for which Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſo much altered the Face of the Church from what it was under the <hi>Moſaical Oeconomy,</hi> Firſt, becauſe very many of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremonies were <note n="†" place="margin">Ac primò ita his in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut antity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus in typi locum ſucce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat, eumque adeo loco moveat, ut ſimul atque antitypus adſit, nullus deinceps typo locus, nullus uſus reperiatur. <hi>Outramus</hi> de Sacrificiis, Lib. 2. c. 16. p. 204.</note> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt and Chriſtianity; and Secondly, becauſe many of them were inconſiſtent with the nature of a manly, free and univerſal Church, ſuch as Chriſt intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſhould be.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then, many of the Eccleſiaſtical rites, and uſages of the <hi>Jews</hi> were laid aſide, at the time of Reformation, becauſe they were fulfilled in Chriſt, as the Antitype, and Subſtance of them, as is plain from the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16. Let no man judge you in Meat, or in <hi>Drink,</hi> or in reſpect of an <hi>Holyday,</hi> or of the New <hi>Moons,</hi> or of the Sabbath days, which are a Shadow of things that are to come <hi>to paſs;</hi> but the Body is Chriſt: that is to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52302:8"/>
ſay, Let no Man impoſe upon you the Doctrine of <hi>Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Abſtinence,</hi> or condemn you for eating and drinking things prohibited by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, or for not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their Feaſts, New Moons and Sabbaths, which are but Types of Chriſtianity; and therefore ought to be laid aſide. The like he doth ſhew in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> concerning the Temple, Prieſthood, Altar, Sacrifices, and the whole Temple-Service; as is plain from many Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, whereof I ſhall recite ſome. The Prieſthood being changed, there is made alſo of neceſſity a change in the Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 22. The Holy Ghoſt, this <hi>ſignifying</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the way into the holieſt of all, was not yet made manifeſt, while, as the firſt Tabernacle was yet ſtanding, which was but a <hi>Figure</hi> for the time then preſent, in which were offered both Gifts and Sacrifices; that could not make him that did the Service perfect <hi>[and cleanſed]</hi> as pertaining to the Conſcience, which ſtood, or conſiſted only in a certain uſe of Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and other carnal Ordinances impoſed on them, <hi>[as Types]</hi> until the time of Reformation <hi>[by Chriſt] Chap.</hi> 9.8, 9, 10. So <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. Chriſt <hi>[with the Blood of his Sacrifice]</hi> is not entred into the Holy Places made with Hands, which are the <hi>Figures</hi> of the true. And after all, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 1. the Law having only a Shadow of the good things to come, and not the Solidity of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, can never with thoſe <hi>[umbratical]</hi> Sacrifices, which they offered year by year continually make the Comers thereunto perfect.</p>
            <p>It would make a Book of it ſelf, to recite all the Types and Shadows of the Old Teſtament, which are applied to Chriſt and Chriſtianity by the Writers under the New. Beſides what occurs in the Apoſtles Writings, there is much to the ſame purpoſe in the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which is very ancient; the Dialogue of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew;</hi> and the Fourth Book of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inſiſting upon many typical things, and perſons in the Old Teſtament, at laſt concludes in the 38th Chapter, <hi>Nihil enim vacuum, nihil ſine ſigno;</hi> that almoſt every thing in it was typical, and had a myſtical Reference to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the New.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52302:9"/>But Secondly, as many of the Eccleſiaſtical Rites, and Uſages of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church were taken away, becauſe they were fulfilled in Chriſt and Chriſtianity, ſo many others were annulled, as being inconſiſtent with the nature of the Church-Chriſtian, as it was to be a <hi>manly, free,</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As it was to be a <hi>manly</hi> Church in oppoſition to the legal Pedagogy of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> called it in ſaying, That <hi>the Law was but a School-maſter to bring them unto Chriſt</hi> [Gal. 3.24] and that the <hi>Jews</hi> were under it as Children are under Tutors, and Governors, until the time appointed by the Father, the Fulneſs of Time, when God ſent forth his Son, [<hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4.] Hither we may refer abundance of thoſe Precepts which concerned their Waſhings, and Purifications, or their Abſtinence from menſtruous Women, and unclean Creatures, which God impoſed upon them in that State of Minority, chiefly to lecture unto them moral Purity and Temperance: For they had childiſh Underſtandings, and were, like Children, to be inſtructed by Symbols, and Symbolical Leſſons, as is plain from the Precept about their Phylacteries, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.38. <hi>Speak unto the Children of Iſrael, and bid them that they make Fringes in the Borders of their Garments throughout their Generations, and that they put upon the Fringes of their borders, a Ribband of Blue, and it ſhall be unto you for a Fringe, that you may look upon it, and remember all the Commandments of the Lord, and do them, and that ye ſeek not after your own Heart, and your own Eyes, after which ye uſe to go a Whoring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Secondly, As many of their Rites and Ceremonies were annulled at the time of Reformation, becauſe they were inconſiſtent with the manly nature of the Chriſtian Religion, ſo others were annulled, becauſe they were not conſiſtent with the free nature of it, in oppoſition to the Servile nature of the Jewiſh Church, which is excellently ſet forth by the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, <hi>&amp;c. Abraham</hi> had two Sons, the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but he that was born of the Bond-maid was born ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh, but he that was born of the Free-woman,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52302:9"/>
was born <hi>[by virtue of the]</hi> Promiſe <hi>which God made unto</hi> Abraham: Which things are an Allegory, for theſe <hi>[two Women]</hi> are the two Covenants. The one the Covenant which was made on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth to Bondage, and this was <hi>Agar.</hi> For this <hi>Agar</hi> is <hi>[the figure of]</hi> Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> and anſwereth to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which now is, and is <hi>[ſtill]</hi> in Bondage with her Children. But [Sarah <hi>is the figure of the Spiritual</hi>] Jeruſalem, which is <hi>[come with Chriſt from]</hi> above, which is the Mother of us all.</p>
            <p>Now this Eccleſiaſtical Bondage, and Servitude of the <hi>Jews,</hi> conſiſted in the vaſt number of their Religious Rites and Obſervances, which if a Man conſider in retail as to the Days, Weeks, Months, and Years, which they were bound to obſerve; the multitude of Sacrifices of all ſorts, which they were bound to offer; the frequent Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Purifications they were bound to undergo; the ſtrict diſtinction they were to make of clean from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Animals; the Rules and Ceremonies they were bound to obſerve at Births, Marriages, Burials, at Bed and Board, at Home and Abroad, in Sickneſs and in Health, nay, even in Plowing, Sowing, and Reaping, he ſhall find that they were left almoſt in nothing to their own Freedom and Diſcretion, but that the Obſervances, to which they were bound in almoſt all their Actions, took up half of their time.</p>
            <p>Such a burdenſom and grievous Oeconomy was that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the <hi>Jews</hi> lived, but yet how ſevere and ſlaviſh ſoever it was, it was ſuitable to the ſlaviſh temper of that People, upon whom God impoſed all theſe Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for the hardneſs of their hearts, and propenſion to Idolatry, as <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>They were apt to forget God, and therefore he loaded them with ſo many Divine Rites and Obſervations, that at all times and places, and in every action, they might be put in mind of him, and this Ceremonial Yoke was ſo heavy upon them, that it was little leſs than intolerable, according to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Why tempt ye God to put a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52302:10"/>
Yoke upon the Neck of the Diſciples, which neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear?</hi> This he ſaid in the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> againſt the believing Phariſees, who taught, that it was needful to Circumciſe the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians, and to command them to keep the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, not yet rightly underſtanding, or believing, that it was one end of Chriſt's coming to ſet them free from the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, as the Apoſtles then declared, and as St. <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards inſtructed the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who were led away into this error, ſaying, <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the Liberty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſt hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the Yoke of Bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hither therefore we are to refer the annulling not ſo much of any particular ſort of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies as of the whole Maſs of them, even the diſſolution of the whole Ceremonial Law, of which the <hi>Jews</hi> were grown weary, and with which they had been for a long time heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when Chriſt called them to take his Yoke and Burden upon them, which was to be ſo eaſie, and light.</p>
            <p>But then in the laſt place, as the obligatory force of all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremonies were taken away, becauſe they were inconſiſtent with the free nature of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church: So ſome more eſpecially were annulled, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiſtent with the univerſality of it, as it was to be a Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>Hither we may refer all thoſe which were ſet up by God as <note n="*" place="margin">Maimonides more Nevoch. p. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>37.</hi>

God injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them theſe, and other things in oppoſition to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Idolatrous Nations, that there might be a mutual ſtrangeneſs and hatred betwixt them, and that by theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52302:10"/>
and other Ceremonial Singularities, they might be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt of the World. But then Chriſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to break down the middle wall of Partition betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to aboliſh the Enmity of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that was betwixt them, that he might make Peace betwixt them, and reconcile them both into one Body in the Croſs, it was requiſite to this end, that he ſhould abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh theſe, and all other diſtinguiſhing Characters betwixt them, which would have hindred the Progreſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, had it been clogg'd with <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which were become ſo odious, and ridiculous to all the Gentile World.</p>
            <p>In particular, For this reaſon he was obliged to change the Initiatory Sacrament, and the Seal of the Covenant of Grace, I mean <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> by which the <hi>Jews</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a few <note n="*" place="margin">The ancient Egyptians, Ethiopians, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites, Chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chians.</note> Nations) were diſtinguiſhed from all the World.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it alone was reckoned as a grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by reaſon of the painful and bloody nature of it; and for that Reaſon alſo was laid aſide, as being inconſiſtent with the free and eaſie nature of the Chriſtian Religion; for if <hi>Zipporah</hi> was ſo much offended at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and called him a bloody Husband upon the account of it, we may well preſume how much the Gentiles would have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the Apoſtles, and at their Doctrine, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof.</p>
            <p>No Religious Rite could be more ungrateful to Fleſh and Blood, and therefore the Wiſdom of our Lord is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired in changing of it into the eaſie and practicable Ceremony of Baptiſm; which was of more univerſal

            <p>Now to ſhew that Circumciſion was not a Type but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Fore-runner of Baptiſm, we muſt note, that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and properly ſpeaking, there was the ſame difference betwixt the Type and the Antitype, as betwixt the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the Subſtance, or betwixt a Man and his Picture in a Glaſs; <note n="*" place="margin">Deinde (quod maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè adverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum) id inter Antitypum &amp; Typum inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, quod quae <hi>revera</hi> in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titypo vis in eſt, ea non niſi ſpecie tenus, aut gradu longè exiliori in Typo extiterit.

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52302:12"/>Thus the blood of the Legal Sacrifices were but Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and Repreſentations of the Blood of Chriſt, and the purging and cleanſing Virtue in their Blood, ſerving to the purifying of the Fleſh, was alſo but a faint and umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reſemblance of the more noble and efficacious clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Virtue of his Blood which purges the Conſcience from dead works. So the Brazen Serpent was but a Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow or Symbol of Chriſt upon the Croſs, and the healing Virtue which, belonged to it, was but a figure, or ſhadow of that more eminent, and powerfully healing Virtue, which was in Jeſus Chriſt. But the caſe is not ſo betwixt Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and Baptiſm, becauſe Circumciſion hath no Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal likeneſs with Baptiſm, nor any thing belonging to it common with Baptiſm, which doth not as literally, properly, fully, and eminently belong unto it, as unto Baptiſm it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For Firſt, Is Baptiſm a Sacrament of initiation into the Covenant of Grace under the Goſpel? So was Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before, and under the Law. Is Baptiſm now a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith? So was Circumciſion then. Doth it properly, and effectually confirm and eſtabliſh the Covenant betwixt God and us now? So did Circumciſion then, as it is written, you ſhall Circumciſe the Fleſh of your Fore-skin, and it ſhall be a Token of the Covenant betwixt me and you. Baptiſm doth nothing under the Goſpel, which Circumciſion did not as properly, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually under the Law. This was then as abſolute and real a Sacrament, as that now is. This did then as really initiate true Believers, as that now doth. It never was an Umbraticall Sacrament, or ſhadow of another Sacrament, it never did Umbratically initiate Believers, or Umbrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and in ſhew and Similitude only confirm the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betwixt God, and the Seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not be a Type of Baptiſm, no more than the Broad Seal of <hi>England</hi> 300 Years ago was a Type of this.</p>
            <p>Accordingly it is never mentioned in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as a Type of Baptiſm, nor Baptiſm, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype of it; but on the contrary, the only Typical Adumbrations which are found of it in the Goſpel, are ſuch things, which have ſome Symbolical likeneſs

            <p>But as for Circumciſion it hath nothing in it Symbolical of Baptiſm, nor was it an Umbratical, but a real Conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Covenant of Grace, every way as real, and ſubſtantial an Ordinance, as Baptiſm now is, and therefore ſucceeded in the room of it, not as the Antitype did in the place of the Type, but as one abſolute Ordinance or poſitive Inſtitution doth in the place of another, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apoſtle, who ſaith unto the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> — <hi>In whom alſo ye are Circumciſed, with the Circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, having been buried with him in Baptiſm,</hi> Col. 2.11, 12.</p>
            <p>But in the ſecond place, if we conſider the Original of Baptiſm, as a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Inſtitution, we ſhall find it very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that Circumciſion ſhould be a Type of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, let us proceed to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the former Queſtions. And firſt of all,</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" n="I" unit="Quest."/>
            <p>Queſt. I. <hi>Whether Infants are uncapable of Baptiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, conſidering what hath already been ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Spiritual and Evangelical Nature of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the initiation of young Children into it by God's eſpecial appointment, cannot without raſhneſs be affirmed. Nothing can reflect more diſhonour upon the Wiſdom of God, and the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church than to aſſert Infants to be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſame privilege, which God, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church granted unto them. For God commanded them to be Circumciſed, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church commanded them to be Baptized, as well adult Proſelytes, and if they were then capable both of Circumciſion, and Baptiſm, ſurely they are capable of Baptiſm now.</p>
            <p>If they be not, from whence comes the difference? Not from the Nature of the Covenants, for the Covenant, which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed, was, as I have ſhew'd, the ſame Covenant for ſubſtance, which he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52302:14"/>
hath ſince renew'd with us in Chriſt: Nor from the Signs and Seals of the Covenant; for Circumciſion was a Sign and Seal of the ſame Grace, or of the ſame Righteouſneſs of Faith under the Old Teſtament, that Baptiſm is now under the New.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſince the Covenants were for ſubſtance the ſame, both Spiritual and Evangelical Covenants, and the Grace of thoſe Covenants the very ſame, and only the Rites and Ceremonies which were Signs of thoſe Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and Seals of that Grace being different; what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the nature of the thing, but that Infants who were capable of the one, ſhould not alſo be capable of the other? Is Baptiſm a more Spiritual Ordinance than Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion? That cannot be, becauſe Circumciſion is a Goſpel-Ordinance; I mean, an Ordinance of the Goſpel which God <hi>preached before unto</hi> Abraham, and if the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of outward Ordinances are to be meaſured from the ends of their inſtitution, then Circumciſion was every way as Spiritual as Baptiſm, becauſe it really ſigned the ſame Covenant, and ſealed the ſame Grace, and was a Ceremony of Initiation to the ſame Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that Baptiſm now is.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if the relative nature of Circumciſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a Sacrament, was the ſame under the Law, that Baptiſm is under the Goſpel, it muſt needs follow, that Children under the Goſpel, are as capable of this (ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing no new Command to exclude them) as under the Law, they were of that; if Infant Church-Memberſhip, or the Initiation of Infants was then no abſurdity, ſurely it can be none now: If God under the Old Teſtament vouchſafed it as a gracious Priviledge unto Children to be incorporated with actual Believers, and with them to be made members of his Church; without a Prohibition to the contrary, they muſt needs be capable of the ſame Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge ſtill Nay, if Infants were admitted into the Church, when the entrance into it was more grievous, and not without blood, how unreaſonable is it to aſſert, that they are now uncapable of admiſſion into it, when the entrance into it is made more eaſie, and more agreeable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52302:14"/>
to the natural weakneſs of a young and tender Child? Certainly if the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Infants were Circumciſed with the moſt painful and bloody Circumciſion made with hands, Chriſtian Infants, without a Special Countermand from God, muſt be deemed capable of the Circumciſion made without hands, I mean of Baptiſm, which is the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of Chriſt. What God hath Sanctified, and Adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made a Member of his Church, let no Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to think it uncapable of Sanctification, Adoption, and Church-Memberſhip, but yet ſo raſh and extravagant have the profeſs'd Adverſaries of Infant-Baptiſm been, as to pronounce little Infants as uncapable of Baptiſm, as the young ones of unreaſonable Creatures, and that it is as vain to call upon God to ſend his Holy Spirit upon them, as to pray him to illuminate a Stone or a Tree.</p>
            <p>Nay, upon this very Preſumption, that Infants are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Baptiſm, they aſſert Infant-Baptiſm to be a Scandalous abuſe of the Ordinance of Baptiſm, a meer Nullity and inſignificant performance, and ſcornfully call it <hi>Baby-Baptiſm,</hi> forgetting all this while that Circumciſion of Infants was no ſcandalous abuſe of the Ordinance of Circumciſion, but a valid and ſignificant Performance, and that in their Phraſe there was <hi>Baby-Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>Baby-Baptiſm</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why they conclude Infants uncapable of Baptiſm, is taken from the conſideration of their incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to ſome ends and uſes of Baptiſm, which cannot be anſwered (ſay they) but by the Baptiſm of grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who are capable of underſtanding the Goſpel, and of profeſſing their Faith, and Repentance, and of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto Baptiſm, and of having their Faith and Hope further ſtrengthned in the uſe of it; but Infants being ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable of underſtanding the Goſpel, or of profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Faith, and Repentance, and of ſubmitting unto Baptiſm in which they are meerly paſſive, or of having their Faith ſtrengthned in the uſe of it, they ought to be deemed uncapable of Baptiſm, whoſe ends are ſo much fruſtrated, when it is applied unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:52302:15"/>But this way of arguing, how plauſible ſoever it may ſeem at firſt hearing, is weak and fallacious, and highly reflecting upon the Council, and Wiſdom of God.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is weak and fallacious, becauſe it makes no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt a <hi>ſtrict inſtitution,</hi> which is inſtituted by God for one, or a few ends, and preciſely for Perſons of one ſort, and an <hi>Inſtitution of Latitude,</hi> which is inſtituted by him for ſeveral ends, and for different ſorts of Perſons differently qualified for thoſe ſeveral ends. Of the firſt ſort, was the <hi>Ordinance of Fringes</hi> above-mentioned, which could only concern grown Perſons, becauſe they only were capable of anſwering the end, for which it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, <hi>viz. To look upon them and remember the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord,</hi> and of the latter ſort is the Holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Marriage, which was appointed by God for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ends, and for Perſons differently qualified, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated for thoſe ſeveral ends, in ſo much, that Perſons, who are incapacitated as to ſome ends of Marriage, may yet honeſtly Marry, becauſe they are capable of the reſt. All the ends and uſes, for which it was appointed can only be anſwered by the Marrying of Perſons who are capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated for procreation of <hi>Children,</hi> notwithſtanding ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annuated Perſons, who are paſt that capacity, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable Subjects of Marriage, nor is the Marriage of ſuch invalid, or an abuſe of the Holy Ordinance of Marriage, becauſe they are capable of anſwering one end, for which Marriage was ordained.</p>
            <p>This ſhews how fallaciouſly the Anabaptiſts argue againſt Baptizing of Infants, becauſe of their incapacity as to ſome ends and uſes for which Baptiſm was ordained; they ought firſt to have proved, what they take for granted, that it was a Divine Inſtitution of the firſt ſort, which I call a <hi>ſtrict Inſtitution,</hi> and then their Argument had been good, but this they will never be able to prove, becauſe Baptiſm ſucceeded in the room of Circumciſion, which was a Divine Inſtitution of the latter ſort, and becauſe our Saviour was Baptiſed, in whom there was a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity, as to the ends of Baptiſm, than poſſibly can be in <hi>Infants,</hi> even as he was in a greater incapacity as to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52302:15"/>
anſwering the ends of Circumciſion, than ordinary <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Infants</hi> were. <hi>John</hi> verily did Baptize with the Baptiſm of Repentance, and thereby ſealed unto the People the Remiſſion of their Sins, and therefore underſtanding very well that our Lord was not capable of this, and other ends of his Baptiſm, he forbad him, telling him, that he was fitter to be the Baptiſt, than to be Baptized of him; but yet as ſoon as our Lord gave him one general reaſon why he ought to be Baptized, <hi>viz. Becauſe it became him to fulfil all Righteouſneſs,</hi> he ſuffered him, which ſhews that Baptiſm is a Divine <hi>Inſtitution of Latitude,</hi> and that in ſuch an <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> the incapacity of a Perſon, as to ſome ends, doth not incapacitate him for it, when he is capable of the reſt.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, This way of arguing from the incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Infants,</hi> as to ſome ends of Baptiſm is highly reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Wiſdom of God; who commanded young Babes to be Circumciſed, although all the ends of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion could not be anſwered, but by the Circumciſion of adult Perſons, who only were capable of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and the nature of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> into which they were to enter, of profeſſing their Faith and Repentance, and of ſubmitting unto the bloody Sacrament, in which Children were merely Paſſive, and of having their Faith and Hope further ſtrengthned upon fealing unto them the Remiſſion of their Sins.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, the full force of this Objection riſes up againſt <hi>Infant-Circumciſion,</hi> as well as <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was inſtituted for the ſame ends, that Baptiſm now is, and accordingly when Men were initiated by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion they were to profeſs their Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and ſhortly after at their Baptiſm ſolemnly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Idolatry, and all idolatrous Manners and Worſhip, and their idolatrous Kindred and Relations; and yet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deſire of ſuch Proſelytes, their Children were initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated both by Circumciſion, and Baptiſm, though they were altogether uncapable of underſtanding, or doing thoſe things which their Fathers did.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:52302:16"/>Wherefore, thoſe Men who argue againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe it doth not anſwer all the ends of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Divine Wiſdom, and the Wiſdom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, not conſidering, that Circumciſion was, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is an Inſtitution of <hi>great Latitude</hi> and compaſs, deſigned on purpoſe by God for Children, in whom there is a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ſome, nay, for the <note n="*" place="margin">Rem Praeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puam in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo non at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendunt, hoc eſt teſtificationem divinae benevolentiae in foedus &amp; tutelam ſuam ſuſcipientis &amp; gratiam conferentis, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nam in Baptiſmo praecipua res eſt divina gratia, quae conſiſtit in remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione peccatorum, regeneratione, adoptione, haereditate Vitae aeternae, cujus ſane gratiae Infantes &amp; indigentes &amp; capaces ſunt. <hi>Caſſand. de Bapt.

               </note> chief ends of Baptiſm, as well as for Men and Women, in whom there is a capa,city for all.</p>
            <p>They are capable of all the ends of it, as it is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a Sign from God towards us, to aſſure us of his Gracious favour, and to conſign unto us the benefits of the Covenant of Grace. For their Child-hood doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that they may be made Members of the Church, as of a Family, Tribe, Colledge, or any other Society, nor doth it incapacitate them any more from being adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Children of God, than the Children of any other Perſon, nor of becoming Heirs of Eternal Life by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Adoption, than by vertue of any other civil Adoption, the Heirs to ſuch a Temporal Eſtate. For Children are capable of all acts of Favour and Honour from God and Men, and of being inſtated in all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of any Society, though they cannot as yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duties of it, nor underſtand any thing thereof. Since therefore, Children are as capable, and ſtand as much in need of almoſt all the Benefits of the Covenant of Grace, and the Priviledges of Church Memberſhip as Men, is it not as fit that the Confirmatory Sign of thoſe <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> ſhould be applied unto them as well as unto theſe? Should a Prince Adopt a <hi>Beggar</hi>'s Child, and incorporate him into the Royal Family, and ſettle a part of his Dominions upon him, and to ſolemnize and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm all this, ſhould cut off a bit of his Fleſh, or command him to be waſhed with Water, who would count this an inſignificant Solemnity, or ſay, that the <hi>Child</hi> was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52302:16"/>
of the Sign, when he was capable of the chief Things ſignified thereby? Or to make a Compariſon, which hath a nearer ſemblance with <hi>the Caſe of Infant-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</hi> Suppoſe a Prince ſhould ſend for an attainted Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's <hi>Child,</hi> and in the Preſence of ſeveral Perſons aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for that purpoſe, ſhould ſay: <hi>You know the Blood of this Child is attainted by his Fathers Treaſon, by Law he hath forfeited all Right to his Anceſtors Eſtate, and Titles, and is quite undone, though he be not ſenſible of his wretched Condition. My Bowels of Compaſſion yern upon him, and here I reſtore him to his Blood and Inheritance, to which henceforward he ſhall have as much right, as if the Family had never been attainted. I juſtifie him freely, and declare my ſelf reconciled unto him, and that no ſpot or imputation may hereafter lay upon him, I here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you all waſh him with pure water, to ſignifie that he is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his. Original Attaindure and Corruption of Blood, and that he is as fully reſtored to his Birth-right, as if he had never been Attaint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe this were done for a poor attainted Infant, could any Man ſay that the action was inſignificant, and invalid, becauſe the Child knew nothing of it, or that he was incapable of the Sign, when he was capable of being waſhed from the Attaindure, and of being thereby reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his blood, and Birth-right, which was the chief thing ſignified thereby?</p>
            <p>Theſe things ſhould be well conſidered by the Deſpiſers of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> againſt whom I may urge for Precedents the Circumciſion, and Baptiſm of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, both theſe, as I muſt often obſerve, were applied unto Infants as well as adult, and actual Believers under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and accordingly, tho' <hi>Abraham</hi> believed, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly profeſſed his Faith before he was Circumciſed, yet I hope they will not ſay that God acted fooliſhly, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding <hi>Iſaac, &amp;c.</hi> to be Circumciſed before he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ends of Circumciſion, or could believe, much leſs make profeſſion of his Belief. He was entered Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally into Covenant with God before he was able to recontract, or underſtand what the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was, but yet I preſume they will not ſay he was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52302:17"/>
in vain, although he was under the very ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity as to the ends of Circumciſion, that Infants are of Baptiſm now.</p>
            <p>The beſt way, that I know, they have of evading the force of this Argument, is by ſaying, that Circumciſion was more proper for Infants than Baptiſm, becauſe it left a ſignificant Mark, and Character in their Fleſh, whereas Baptiſm is a tranſient Sign, and leaves no ſignificant Impreſſion behind it, whereby to inſtruct Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men what was done unto them in their Infancy. But this is a meer ſhift:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Mark, and Character, which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion left in the Fleſh of the Child, was as inſignificant to him during the time of his Non-age, as Baptiſm is to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Infants,</hi> neither afterwards could he tell, but by the inſtruction of others, what the meaning of that Character was, and for what ends it was imprinted in his Fleſh. And therefore, according to their way of reaſoning againſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,</hi> it ought to have been deferred till the full years of diſcretion, when the Circumciſed Perſon might have underſtood the Spiritual Signification thereof.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, in anſwer to this Objection, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them, that the Mark and Character which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion left behind it, was of no force, or ſignification, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it did appear from the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezrah</hi> 2.62. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.5.64.</note> Regiſters of the Tribes, that the Perſon circumciſed was a <hi>Jew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, the <hi>Character</hi> which <hi>Circumciſion</hi> left behind it, was merely of it ſelf of no force nor ſignification without the Regiſters, or written <hi>Genealogies,</hi> becauſe without them neither the circumciſed Perſon himſelf, nor the <hi>Church</hi> could know in many <hi>Circumſtances</hi> whether he were a true Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or an <hi>Egyptian, Iſmaelite,</hi> or <hi>Samaritan,</hi> who were all <hi>Circumciſed</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews.</hi> If <hi>Baptiſm</hi> then be a <hi>Tranſient, Circumciſion</hi> was an <hi>Equivocal</hi> Sign, and therefore theſe pretended circumſtantial Differences ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, nor make any ſubſtantial difference betwixt <hi>Circumciſion</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as to the capacity of <hi>Infants</hi> unto both. They are capable of contracting a Spiritual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto God by this, as formerly they were by that; they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52302:17"/>
are capable of having their Spiritual attaindure removed; they are capable of receiving the Bleſſings of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> tho' they cannot perform the duties of it, and God may ſolemnly bind himſelf unto them, tho' they cannot as yet perſonally bind themſelves unto him.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Allowing that Circumciſion was more proper for Infants, than Baptiſm, yet this difference is wholly avoided by referring the Practice of Infant-Baptiſm not only unto Infant. Circumciſion, but unto the Original Practice of Infant-Baptiſm in the <hi>Jewiſh Church;</hi> which underſtood very well, that it was but a tranſient rite, and left no Character upon the perſon, who was initiated thereby. Thoſe therefore who take upon them to argue againſt Infant-Baptiſm from this or any other pretended reaſon, take upon them to cenſure, and condemn the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, which for many Ages Baptiſed Infants, and Minor Proſelytes into the Covenant, as well as actual Believers, and yet were never cenſured, or reproved for it by any Prophet, which we may preſume they would have been, had Baptiſmal Initiation of Infants into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant been ſo abſurd, Inſignificant, and abuſive a practice, as the Profeſſors againſt Infant-Baptiſm vainly pretend it is.</p>
            <p>Having now, I hope, ſufficiently proved, that Infants are not uncapable Subjects of Baptiſm. Let us proceed to ſtate the next Queſtion, which is this.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" n="II" unit="Quest."/>
            <p>Queſt. II. <hi>Whether Infants are excluded from Baptiſm by Chriſt?</hi>

            <p>Where, in the firſt place, I muſt obſerve, that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ought to be propoſed in theſe Terms, and not <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt hath commanded Infants to be Baptized?</hi> For as a good <note n="*" place="margin">Herodot. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.</note> Author obſerves of the River <hi>Nile,</hi> that we ought not to ask the reaſon, <hi>Why</hi> Nile <hi>overflows ſo many days about the Summer-ſolſtice?</hi> But rather <hi>Why it doth not overflow all the Year long?</hi> So in the Controverſie about Infant Baptiſm, the enquiry ought not to be, whether Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Infants to be Baptized? But whether he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them from Baptiſm? Becauſe, conſidering the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church as to Infant-Circumciſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52302:18"/>
and Infant-Baptiſm too, it muſt needs be granted, that a Command from Chriſt, to initiate Proſelytes out of all Nations into the Chriſtian Religion, muſt without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the contrary, be underſtood to comprehend In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as well as Men.</p>
            <p>As for Example, ſuppoſe our Saviour had not changed the Seal of the Covenant,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling-fleets</hi> Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>A.

            <p>And if a command to Proſelyte and Circumciſe all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would, without an exception, have comprehended Infants, as well as Men, why ſhould it be imagined that the command to Proſelyte and Baptize all Nations ſhould not likewiſe comprehend them, ſeeing that Infant-Baptiſm, as well as Infant-Circumciſion had been the immemorial Practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>This is ſo true, that ſuppoſing our Saviour had intended the gathering of Churches among the Gentiles according to the Old Teſtament, and the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, he need not have expreſſed his meaning in any other manner, than by ſaying unto the Apoſtles; <hi>Go Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyte all Nations,</hi> Circumciſing <hi>and</hi> Baptiſing <hi>of them,</hi> &amp;c. Nay he could ſcarce have expreſſed his Intentions in a more emphatical or intelligible manner unto them, who being <hi>Jews</hi> muſt needs have the ſame Apprehenſions as to the Subjects of Initiation, and Church-Memberſhip under the Goſpel, that they had under the Law. They had lived under a Diſpenſation, where Infants were initiated both by Circumciſion and Baptiſm into the Church, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they had been inſtructed to the contrary, they muſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52302:18"/>
naturally have underſtood their Commiſſion of Baptizing to have extended unto Infants, as well as actual Believers; as if, for inſtance, God ſhould now extraordinarily call twelve Men of any Chriſtian Nation, where Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm had been a conſtant and univerſal Practice, and bid them <hi>go, and Proſelyte the</hi> Indians, <hi>baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. None of theſe Men could poſſibly imagine, that Infants were excepted out of their Commiſſion; but common n<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e, on the contrary, would oblige them to underſtand it according to the uſage of their own Church.</p>
            <p>Beſides, abſtracting at preſent from the Controverſie, Whether Chriſt did, or did not exclude Infants from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm? What reaſon can any Man give, why he who fetched ſo many of his Inſtitutions from <hi>Jewiſh</hi> uſages, ſhould exclude them from it, and recede in this Point from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>They are every way as capable of the viſible Signs of Gods inviſible favour, and of the Benefits of the <hi>Abrahami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Covenant under the New Teſtament, as they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old, they are as fit Subjects of Baptiſm now, as they were of Circumciſion and Baptiſm then, their initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into both Churches ſeems to be equally rational, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, though the ſign of the Covenant be altered, yet the Covenant ſtill remains the ſame. In a word, there lay no Obligation upon our <hi>Bleſſed Lord,</hi> to lay aſide the practice of Infant-Baptiſm, as being inconſiſtent either with the <hi>Free,</hi> or the <hi>Manly,</hi> or <hi>Univerſal</hi> nature of the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much I have ſaid to ſhew, why the Queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the Diſſenters upon the account of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> ſhould be, <hi>Whether Chriſt hath excluded Infants from Baptiſm?</hi> And not <hi>Whether he hath commanded Infants to be Baptized?</hi> And certainly, the Premiſes being conſidered, there is far more reaſon to conclude, that Chriſt ſhould have prohibited Infants from Baptiſm, if it had been his intention not to have them Baptized, than that he ſhould have commanded them to be Baptized, if it had been his intention to continue the practice of Infant-Baptiſm. For he need not have commanded his Apoſtles to do that,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52302:19"/>
which they would naturally have done of themſelves without a Prohibition, and that he did not prohibit them to Baptize Infants, is now the thing to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in ſhewing, that he did not exclude Infants from Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>For if he excluded them from Baptiſm, he either exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them from it directly by an expreſs Prohibition not to Baptiſe them, or conſequentially by ſo limiting, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the Subject of Baptiſm, as to make it unapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto them.</p>
            <p>That he never excluded them by any expreſs Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> themſelves do grant, becauſe there is no ſuch Prohibition to be found in the New Teſtament; but then they pretend, that it was Chriſt's intention that grown Perſons ſhould be the only Subjects of Baptiſm, becauſe the Goſpel requires, that Perſons to be Baptized ſhould firſt be <hi>Taught, Believe,</hi> and <hi>Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, The Goſpel requires, that they ſhould be Taught, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.29. <hi>Go and teach all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they ſhould believe, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and Preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He that Believeth, and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Repentance, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be Baptized every one of you in the Name of</hi> Jeſus.</p>
            <p>But now, ſay they, theſe three Qualifications before Baptiſm, can belong to none but grown Perſons, to Men and Women, at years of diſcretion, and therefore none but ſuch ought to be Baptized. And accordingly, we find that Baptiſm was practiſed upon theſe terms throughout the Hiſtory of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2. Repentance and Faith are mentioned as prerequiſite qualifications to Baptiſm in theſe Words, <hi>Not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from deadly works, and of Faith towards God, of the Doctrine of Baptiſms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Arguments, by which the Adverſaries of Infant-Baptiſm endeavour to prove, that Chriſt ſo limited the ſubject of Baptiſm, as to exclude Infants from it. But in this they are grievouſly miſtaken, becauſe theſe, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52302:19"/>
the like Texts do of themſelves no more prove, that grown perſons are the only Subjects of Baptiſm, than the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. prove that grown Perſons only are to eat. The Apoſtles words are theſe: <hi>When we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither ſhould he eat.</hi> From whence in their Sophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal way it may be argued thus.</p>
            <p>It belongs only to grown Perſons to eat, becauſe the Apoſtle requires, that Perſons who eat, ſhould firſt Work; but now this Apoſtolical qualification of working can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none but grown Perſons, and therefore none but ſuch ought to eat.</p>
            <p>I have made uſe of this Parallel inſtance to ſhew how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluſive the former way of arguing againſt Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is in it ſelf, and how impoſſible it is to prove from the Texts above-mentioned, or any other like them, that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is reſtrained to grown Perſons, becauſe none but grown Perſons can be Taught, Believe, and Repent. And I will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcover the weakneſs and fallacy of this Argument from a familiar Compariſon, which any common Capacity may underſtand.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe then there were a great Plague in any Country, and God ſhould miraculouſly call eleven, or twelve Men, and Communicate unto them a certain Medicine againſt this Plague, and ſay unto them: <hi>Go into ſuch a Country, and call the People of it together, and teach them the Virtues of this Medicine, and aſſure them, that he that believeth, and taketh it from you, ſhall Live, but he that believeth not, ſhall Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Suppoſition I demand of theſe Diſſenters, if the words of ſuch a Commiſſion would be ſufficient for the Miſſioners that received it, or any others to conclude, that it was God's intention, that they ſhould adminiſter his revealed Medicine to none, but grown Perſons, <hi>Becauſe they only could be called together, and taught the Virtues of it, and believe or disbelieve them who brought it.</hi> No certainly, this way of arguing would not be admitted by any rational Man, becauſe the Children would be as capable of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as the Men, though they were ignorant of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it, and merely paſſive in the Adminiſtration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:52302:20"/>Wherefore ſeeing Children, as I have ſhewed, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the benefits of Baptiſm, and ſeeing the Apoſtles who received a Commiſſion to go and Teach, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all Nations, Or, as it is in the words of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> to Preach the Goſpel to every Creature, ſaying, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and is Baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I ſay, ſeeing Children are capable of the benefits of Baptiſm, and the Apoſtles, who received this Commiſſion, knew them to be capable of it, and to have had both Circumciſion, and Baptiſm adminiſtred to them in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, how ſhould they, or any others imagine from the tenure of ſuch a Commiſſion, which was given unto them, as Planters of Churches, but that it was Chriſt's intention that Children, as well as grown Perſons were to be Baptized?</p>
            <p>Should God in the days of <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Solomon,</hi> have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eleven or twelve Prophets, and given them the ſame Commiſſion, which <hi>[Mutatis Mutandis]</hi> Chriſt gave to his Apoſtles, bidding them go and Teach all Nations the Law, Circumciſing, and Baptizing of them in the Name of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and teaching them to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had commanded them, I ſay, ſhould he have ſent them out to Preach the Law to every Creature, ſaying, <hi>He that believeth, aad is Circumciſed, and baptized, ſhall be ſaved, but he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> would a Commiſſion ſo worded have been of it ſelf a ſufficient ground for them to think, that it was God's intention to reſtrain Circumciſion and Baptiſm to adult Perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church? Or, if in a ſhort Hiſtory of their Miſſion, and Undertaking, we ſhould have read, that they Circumciſed, and Baptized as many Proſelytes, as gladly received their word, would this have been an Argument that they did not alſo Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Baptize the Infants of thoſe believing Proſelytes, according to the Laws, and Uſages of their Mother-Church? No certainly, ſuch a Commiſſion to Proſelyte Strangers to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, could not in reaſon have been ſtrained to prejudice the cuſtomary right of Infants to Circumciſion, and Baptiſm, and therefore in parity of reaſon, neither could the Apoſtles ſo underſtand their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52302:20"/>
Commiſſion without other Notices, as to exclude Infants from Sacramental Initiation into the Church.</p>
            <p>The plain truth is, their Commiſſion was a direction how they ſhould proſelyte Strangers to Chriſtianity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of propagating a new Religion in ſtrange Countries, as it is ſet forth by the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 20.14. <hi>How then ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? And how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? And how ſhall they Preach unleſs they be ſent?</hi> Accordingly they were ſent out to Preach, or to Diſciple Men, and Women by Preaching, and to Baptize as many of them, as ſhould upon their Preaching Believe, and Repent. But though the Order of Nature required that they ſhould proceed in this Method with grown Perſons, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to do with Proſelytes to the Law, yet it did not hinder, that they who had been born, and bred <hi>Jews,</hi> ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiate the Infants of ſuch Proſelyted Perſons, according to the uſage of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. What need Chriſt have ſaid more unto them, when he ſent them out, than to bid them <hi>Go, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the</hi> Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, to <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and tell them, <hi>that he that would believe the Goſpel, and be Baptized, ſhould be ſaved.</hi> But then the reſpective ſence of theſe words could only concern adult Perſons, and their qualification for Baptiſm, but could in no reaſon be conſtrued by them, to exclude Infants, but only unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Men, and Women, whereof none were to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church by Baptiſm, before they were taught Chriſtianity, and had confeſſed their Faith and Sins. Should God, as I ſaid before, call twelve Men of any Church, where Infant-Baptiſm had been the conſtant and undoubted practice, and bid them go, and Preach the Goſpel in the <hi>Indies</hi> to every creature, and to ſay, <hi>He that believeth the Doctrine which we Preach, and is Baptized with the Baptiſm which we Adminiſter, ſhall be Saved:</hi> I appeal to any Diſſenter upon the account of Infant-Baptiſm, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he thinks that theſe Men, bred up to the practice of Infant-Baptiſm, could in probability ſo interpret this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52302:21"/>
as to think, that it was God's intention, that they ſhould exclude the Infants of believing Proſelytes from Baptiſmal admiſſion into the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Profeſſors againſt Infant-Baptiſm, put the greateſt ſtreſs upon theſe words of our Saviour: <hi>He that believeth, and is baptized, ſhall be Saved:</hi> But if they would well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the next words, they would find, that Infants are not at all concerned in them, becauſe it follows, <hi>but he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be Damned.</hi> The ſame want of Faith, which here excludes from Baptiſm, excludes alſo from Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and therefore it cannot be underſtood of Infants, unleſs they will ſay with the <note n="*" place="margin">

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is plain, that the believing, and not believing in that Text, is only to be underſtood of ſuch as are in capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of hearing, and believing the Goſpel, that is, of grown Perſons, juſt as the words in <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on the Son of God hath Everlaſting Life, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall not ſee Life, but the Wrath of God abide thou him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far have I proceeded to ſhew, how <hi>inconcluſively</hi> and <hi>abſurdly</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> go about to prove, that <hi>Infants</hi> ought to be excluded from Baptiſm from the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Texts, which ſpeak of the Order of Proſelyting <hi>grown Perſons,</hi> and their Qualifications for Baptiſm; and as little ſucceſs have they with ſome others, which they bring to ſhew how <hi>unprofitable</hi> Baptiſm is for Infants, as that in 1. <hi>Pet:</hi> 3.21. Where the Apoſtle tells us, that external Baptiſm <hi>of putting away the filth of the Fleſh,</hi> of which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are only capable, ſignifies nothing, <hi>but the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God,</hi> of which, ſay they, Infants are altogether uncapable; to which the anſwer is very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, that another Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>external Circumciſion</hi> of which Infants were only capable, <hi>profited nothing without keeping the Law,</hi> which Infants could not keep, nay, that the <hi>outward Circumciſion,</hi> of which Infants were only capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>was nothing,</hi> but that the <hi>inward Circumciſion of the heart, and in the ſpirit was the true Circumciſion,</hi> and yet <hi>Infants</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52302:21"/>
remaining <hi>Infants</hi> were utterly uncapable of that; ſo that their way of arguing from this and ſuch like Texts, proves nothing, becauſe it proves too much, and ſtretches the words of the Apoſtles unto undue conſequences, beyond their juſt Meaning, which was only to let both <hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians know, that there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in external Circumciſion, or Baptiſm, but not that their Infants were unprofitably Circumciſed, and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>So weak, and unconcluding are all the Arguments, by which the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> endeavour from Scripture, to prove, that Chriſt hath limited the Subject of Baptiſm unto grown Perſons; put them all together they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to any tolerable degree of probability, much leſs unto a preſumption, eſpecially if they be put in the ballance againſt the early and univerſal practice of the Catholick Church. Had not the Church been always in poſſeſſion of this practice, or could any time be ſhewed on this ſide the Apoſtles, when it began. Nay, could it be proved, that any one Church in the World did not Baptize Infants, or that any conſiderable number of Men otherwiſe Orthodox, did decline the Baptizing of them upon the ſame Principles, that theſe Men do now, then I ſhould ſuſpect that their Arguments are better than really they are, and that Infant-Baptiſm might poſſibly be a deviation from the rule of Chriſt. But ſince it is ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and ancient a practice, that no body knows when, or where it began, or how from not being it came to be the practice of the Church, ſince there was never any Church Antient or Modern, which did not practiſe it, it muſt argue a ſtrange partiality to think, that it could be any thing leſs, than an Apoſtolical Practice, and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the Original uſe of Baptiſm in its full Latitude under the Goſpel, which it had under the Law. <hi>Had the</hi>

               <hi>Menno,</hi> one of the moſt learned of the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> about the time of the Reformation, was ſo preſſed with this way of arguing, that he acknowledged Infant-Baptiſm to be as old, as the time of the Apoſtles, but then he ſaid, it proceeded from falſe-Apoſtles, and falſe-Teachers in the Apoſtles times. But if it came firſt from falſe Apoſtles, and falſe-Teachers, in the time of the Apoſtles, how came it to paſs that we heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that Innovation in the Writings of the Apoſtles or of their Companions and Contemporaries, ſuch as St. <hi>Clement,</hi> St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> St. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> &amp;c? How came St. <hi>John</hi> who ſurvived unto the latter end of the firſt Century to paſs it over in ſilence, or how came the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Revelations, which by his Pen reproved ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abuſes in the Churches, not to cenſure this? It is very ſtrange, that none of the Pen-men of the Holy-Ghoſt, nor none of their Aſſiſtants, and Companions ſhould animadvert upon ſo ſcandalous an abuſe of the Holy-Ordinance of Baptiſm, which in a ſhort time would fill the Church with ſham Chriſtians, and deſtroy the Eſſence thereof. In like manner, if it came in by falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in the next Age to the Apoſtles, how came it to paſs that none of the famous Saints and Martyrs, who flouriſhed then, oppoſed it as a dangerous Innovation, nor gave us any account thereof? They wrote againſt the Hereſies of <hi>Simon, Menander, Saturnus, Cerinthus, Ebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Valentinus, Baſilides, Marcion,</hi> &amp;c. but we find nothing in them againſt Infant-Baptiſm, though we are ſure from <note n="*" place="margin">Omnes enim venit [Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus] per ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met ipſum ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vare, omnes, inquam, qui per eum <hi>renaſountur</hi> ad deum, infantes, &amp; parvulos, &amp; pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros, &amp; juvenes, &amp; ſeniores. <hi>i. e.

            <p>For firſt, if Infant-Baptiſm was not the Practice of the Apoſtles, but an Innovation, it is very hard to imagine, that God ſhould ſuffer his Church to fall into ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Practice, which would in time Un-Church it, <hi>while Miracles were yet Extant in the Church.</hi> The ſame Holy Spirit, that was the guide of the Apoſtles, into all Truth, was the Author of Miracles too, but the firſt four Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which I have produced for Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>to wit, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> do all likewiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us, that Miracles were then not extraordinary in the Church.</p>

Nay, he tells us, that the number of Spiritual Gifts were innumerable, which the Church all the World over then received from Chriſt, and I truly confeſs it cannot enter into my heart to believe, that God ſhould ſuffer the Church to Embrace ſuch a pernicious Error (as Infant-Baptiſm was, if it was not of Apoſtolical Tradition) and fill the Chriſtian World with Mock-Chriſtians, while he bore them Witneſs with Signs and Wonders, and divers Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

It is very incredible, that God ſhould ſuffer all Churches in all the Parts of the World to fall into one and the ſame Practice, which certainly is a Church-deſtroying Practice, if the Apoſtles and their Aſſiſtants did not Baptize Infants, but only grown Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52302:26"/>One may eaſily imagine, that God might ſuffer all Churches to fall into ſuch an harmleſs Practiſe as that of Infant Communion, or that the Fathers of the Church might comply with the Religious fondneſs of the People, in bringing their Children to the Sacrament, as we do with bringing them to <hi>Prayers,</hi> but that God ſhould let them all (not preſerving any one for a Monument of Apoſtolical Purity) fall into a Practice, which deſtroys the <hi>Being</hi> of the Church, is at leaſt a thouſand times more Incredible, than that the Apoſtles, without a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Chriſt to the contrary, (and no ſuch Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Extant in the New Teſtament) ſhould Baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants according to the Practiſe of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>But in the fourth Place, what Account can rationally be given, why the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians, who were offended at the neglect of Circumciſion, ſhould not have been much more offended, if the Apoſtles had refuſed to <hi>initiate</hi> Children under the New Teſtament, which had always been initiated under the Old. Is it reaſonable to believe, that thoſe, who complained ſo much meerly becauſe the Apoſtles Taught the <hi>Jews,</hi> which lived among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they ſhould not Circumciſe their Children, would not have complained much more if they had not Baptized them, but quite excluded them, like the Infants of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers from Admiſſion into the Church. It muſt in all probability have galled them very much to ſee their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Treated like the Children of meer Strangers, and to have had no viſible difference put between the Infants of thoſe that Embraced, and thoſe that reſiſted the Faith. For they always looked upon <hi>Pagan</hi> Children, as Common, and Unclean, but upon their own, as <hi>Separate,</hi> and <hi>Holy;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes the ſame diſtinction between them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. But had the Apoſtles taught, that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe, who were in Covenant with God, had no more right unto Baptiſmal Initiation, than the Children of <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who were out of the Covenant, they had Taught a Doctrine, which certainly would have offended them more, than all they Preached againſt Circumciſion, and keeping the Ceremonial Law. Wherefore, ſince we
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52302:26"/>
never read among their many Complaints upon the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> Cuſtoms, that they complained of their Childrens not being initiated by Baptiſm, it is a greater preſumption that the Apoſtles, and their Aſſiſtants Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed their Children, then the want of an Expreſs Example of Infant-Baptiſm in the New Teſtament, is that they Baptized them not.</p>
            <p>Having now ſhewed, firſt, that Infants are not uncapable of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That they are not excluded from it by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but that on the contrary, we have very convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to preſume, that the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants,</hi> as well as of grown Perſons, was intended by him. Let us now proceed to make a fair and impartial enquiry upon the Third Queſtion.</p>
            <milestone type="tcpmilestone" n="III" unit="Quest."/>
            <p>Queſt. III. <hi>Whether it is lawful to ſeparate from a Church, which appointeth Infants to be Baptized?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this, conſidering what I have ſaid upon the former Queſtions, muſt be determined in the Negative, <hi>Whether we conſider Infant-Baptiſm only as a thing lawful, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> or, <hi>as a Thing highly requiſite, or neceſſary to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know very well, that my Adverſaries, in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, will be apt to deny this diſtinction betwixt <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Neceſſary;</hi> as acknowledging nothing in Religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be lawful, but what is neceſſary, according to that common Principle imbibed by all ſorts of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> That <hi>nothing is to be appointed in Religious matters, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by ſome Precept, or directed unto by ſome ſpecial Example in the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence they ordinarily ſay, Can you ſhew us any Precept or Example for Baptizing Infants in the New Teſtament, if you can, we will grant, that the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is lawful, but if you cannot, we diſallow it as unlawful, nay, as an <hi>Uſurpation,</hi> and will never be of a Church, which ſo Uſurpeth it over the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of Men.</p>
            <p>This way of Arguing is plauſible to the Vulgar, and would be very good, were there ſuch a Principle in the Scripture, as this, from whence they Argue, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>nothing is to be appointed in Religious matters, but what is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52302:27"/>
by Precept, or Example in the Word of God.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the Men with whom I have to deal in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, are generally Perſons of good natural <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in the Firſt place, I beg them to conſider, that there is no ſuch Rule in the Scripture, as this, and therefore thoſe, who teach it for a Scripture-rule, or Precept, do themſelves impoſe upon Mens <hi>Conſciences,</hi> as bad as <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and, like them and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, teach the Traditions of Men for Doctrines of God. On the contrary, the Goſpel tells us, that <hi>Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of a Law,</hi> and <hi>that where there is no Law there is no Tranſgreſſion;</hi> and according to this plain, and intelligible Rule, though the Baptizing of <hi>Infants</hi> were not commanded in the Scriptures, yet the Church would have Power and Authority to appoint it, upon ſuppoſition that it is not forbid.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I deſire them to conſider the abſurdity of this pretended Scripture-rule, in that it takes away the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt <hi>barely lawful,</hi> or allowable, and neceſſary, and leaves no Negative mean betwixt <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>ſinful,</hi> but makes things forbidden, and things not commanded to be the very ſame.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I deſire them to conſider, what a ſlaviſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple this is, and how <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> it is with the free, and manly nature of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> under which we ſhould be in a far more ſervile, and Childiſh condition, then the <hi>Jews</hi> were under the Law, which as it is evident from the Feaſt of Purim, and <hi>from the Inſtitution of Baptiſm among the</hi> Jews, allowed private Perſons to practice, and the Church to appoint things of a Religious nature, which God had not commanded to be done.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I entreat them to conſider, how utterly impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable this pretended Principle is, as might be proved from the contrary Practice of all thoſe, who advance it againſt Eccleſiaſtical Authority, and particularly from their own Practice, in Baptizing grown Perſons, who were bred up from <hi>Infants</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and in admitting Women to the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> who were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>to the Paſsover, nor Paſchal-cup of Bleſſing,</hi> without
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52302:27"/>
any Precept, or Preſident for ſo doing in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>This little well conſidered, is enough to obviate all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt my firſt Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſeparate from a Church which appointeth Infants to be Baptized,</hi> upon ſuppoſition, <hi>that</hi> Infant-Baptiſm <hi>is barely lawful, and allowable;</hi> but if any man deſire further ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as to this point, he may have it abundantly in <hi>the caſe of indifferent things,</hi> to which I refer him, it being more my buſineſs to ſhew here that <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> is at leaſt, a lawful, and allowable thing.</p>
            <p>To prove this, I need but deſire the Reader to reflect upon the State of the two firſt Queſtions: For if Infants be as capable of Baptiſm under the Goſpel, as they were of Circumciſion under the Law, and if Chriſt have not excluded them from it neither directly, nor conſequenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: Otherwiſe, if Baptiſm be an <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of as great Latitude in its ſelf, as <hi>Circumciſion</hi> its <hi>Fore-runner</hi> was, and Chriſt hath not determined the adminiſtration of it to one Age, more than one Sex: Once more, if Children may be taken into the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, under the Goſpel, as well as under the Law, and Chriſt never ſaid, nor did any thing which can in reaſon be interpreted to forbid them to be taken in: In a word, If they are capable of all the Ends of Baptiſm now, that they were of Circumciſion then, and of having the Priviledges of Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the Bleſſings of the <hi>Covenant</hi> conſigned unto them, and Chriſt neither by himſelf, nor by his Apoſtles did forbid the Church to ſatisfie and fulfil this their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Or laſt of all, If Chriſt hath only appointed Baptiſm inſtead of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> but ſaid nothing to determine the Subject of it, then it muſt needs follow, that <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> muſt at leaſt be lawful, and allowable, becauſe it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and not a forbidden, or ſinful thing. But upon this ſuppoſition, that it were left undetermined, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent by Chriſt, it might like other indifferent things be lawfully appointed by any Church, from which it would be a Sin to ſeparate upon that account. For in this caſe, Churches might ſafely differ in their practice about <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52302:28"/>
as they do now in the Ceremonies of Baptiſm; and thoſe who lived in a Church which did practice it, ought no more to ſeparate from her for appointing of it, then thoſe who lived in another Church, which did not practiſe it, ought to ſeparate from her, for not appointing thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus much I have ſaid, I hope with ſufficient modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon ſuppoſition, that all I have written upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Queſtions, doth but ſatisfactorily prove, that <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> is only lawful, and not highly requiſite and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but then if it be not only lawful, but highly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary, ſo that it ought to be appointed, then it muſt needs be much more ſinful to ſeparate from a Church, which appointeth <hi>Infants</hi> to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>Now, as to the requiſite neceſſity of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that my Reader bears in memory, that I have ſaid upon the laſt Queſtion, (to make it appear with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of credibility, that Chriſt inſtituted Baptiſm for Infants, as well as grown Perſons, and that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and their Companions Practiſed <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi>) I muſt here entreat him further to obſerve, that there is a two-fold neceſſity in matters of <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, one which proceeds from plain dictates of natural reaſon, or from plain and <hi>expreſs words of the Goſpel,</hi> where the ſenſe is ſo obvious and clear, that no ſober man can miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it, or doubt of it, and another which proceeds from <hi>the general Scope and Tenour of the Goſpel, or from doubtful places in it ſo, or ſo underſtood and interpreted by the unanimous voice, and practice of the ancient</hi> Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>The firſt degree of neceſſity is founded on oſtenſive cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and demonſtration, wherein there is no room left for Objection.</p>
            <p>And the Second is founded upon violent preſumption, where the Objections on one hand are inſufficient to move, or at leaſt to turn the Ballance, if put in the Scale againſt the other, which is weighed down <hi>[Mole univerſatis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae]</hi> with the authority of the Univerſal Church. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Rule, like others, is not ſo intelligible without an Example, I will add ſome <hi>Inſtances</hi> of things, which are
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52302:28"/>
neceſſary to be believed, and practiſed by every good Chriſtian under both theſe Notions of neceſſity, that they may be better underſtood.</p>
            <p>According to the Firſt Notion of it, it is neceſſary to believe, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the</hi> Meſſias, <hi>and the Son of God,</hi> becauſe it is delivered in expreſs words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>And according to the Second Notion of it, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to believe, that <hi>he is of the ſame ſubſtance with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and equal unto him,</hi> and that there <hi>are three diſtinct, and coequal Perſons in the God-head, which are all but one God,</hi> becauſe theſe Doctrines, though they are not to be found in expreſs words in the Goſpel, yet they are to be collected from ſeveral places of it, which were always ſo interpreted by that ancient Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>Again, according to the Firſt Notion of neceſſity, it is neceſſary for all Men to believe the Word of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpoken or written, becauſe natural reaſon teacheth us ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And according to the Second Notion of it, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to believe the Books contained in the New Teſtament, to be the Word of God, and no other (how Divine, and Orthodox, and Ancient ſoever they may be) becauſe they, and they only have been received for ſuch by the ancient Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>In like manner as to matter of Practice, by the Firſt ſort of Neceſſity, it is neceſſary for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to aſſemble together to Worſhip God, becauſe Reaſon, and Scripture plainly teach them ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And by the Second fort it is neceſſary, that they ſhould aſſemble themſelves periodically to Worſhip God on every firſt day of the Week, becauſe the Obſervation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> appears to be a Duty from ſeveral places of the New Teſtament, as they are interpreted to this ſence by the univerſal Practice of the ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</p>
            <p>To proceed, according to the Firſt Notion of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Church-Government is neceſſary, becauſe it is enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Dictates of Common reaſon, and moſt expreſs places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:52302:29"/>And according to the Second Notion of it, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to believe the Books contained in the New Teſtament, to be the Word of God, and no other, (how Divine and Orthodox, and Ancient ſoever they may be) becauſe they, and they only have been received for ſuch by the Ancient Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>In like manner as to matter of Practice, by the Firſt ſort of Neceſſity, it is neceſſary for <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to aſſemble together to Worſhip God, becauſe Reaſon, and Scripture plainly teach them ſo to do.</p>
            <p>And by the Second ſort it is neceſſary, that they ſhould aſſemble themſelves periodically to Worſhip God on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt day of the Week, becauſe the Obſervation of the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> appears to be a Duty from ſeveral places of the New Teſtament, as they are interpreted to this ſence by the univerſal Practice of the Ancient Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>To proceed, according to the Firſt Notion of Neceſſity, Church-Government is neceſſary, becauſe it is enjoined by the Dictates of Common reaſon, and moſt expreſs places of Scripture.</p>
            <p>And according to the Second Notion of it, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the Church ſhould be governed by Biſhops (where they can be had) diſtinct from, and Superiour to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> becauſe this <hi>Government</hi> appears to be inſtituted by Chriſt from ſeveral Paſſages of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as they are explained by the uniform Practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, according to the firſt ſort of neceſſity, it is neceſſary to adminiſter the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> becauſe our Saviour hath commanded it in expreſs words.</p>
            <p>And according to the Second, which is alſo an <hi>indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable</hi> degree of Neceſſity, it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>adminiſter</hi> it to <hi>Women,</hi> though they <hi>never</hi> were admitted to the Paſsover, or Paſchal <hi>Poſtcaenium,</hi> which <hi>anſwered</hi> unto it, becauſe we can prove from ſome probable places of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they were admitted unto it, as thoſe places are in equity to be interpreted by the univerſal Practice of the Ancient Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:52302:29"/>To conclude, according to the former Notion of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, it is neceſſary to Baptize, becauſe our Lord hath commanded it in expreſs words.</p>
            <p>And according to the Second, It is in like manner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Baptize Infants, becauſe we can prove their Baptiſm from the Scope, and Tenor of the Goſpel, and from many Paſſages of it, as they are interpreted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Practice of the Ancient Primitive Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From the Scope and Tenour of the Goſpel, which it is reaſonable to preſume, would extend the Subject of Baptiſm, as far as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church extended the Subject both of Circumciſion, and Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, From many Paſſages in the Goſpel, whereof I ſhall recite ſome. <hi>Except a Man be Born again of Water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> John 3.5. <hi>Suffer the little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> Mark 10.14. <hi>The three noted places, which inform us, that the Apoſtles baptized whole Houſholds, as of</hi> Stephanas, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16.

            <p>The requiſite neceſſity of Infant-Baptiſm, may be fairly concluded from theſe Texts.</p>

            <p>But then, as thoſe Texts in Conjunction with Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, do put thoſe Doctrines out of all reaſonable doubt: So do the other, which I have cited in Conjunction with the Practice of the Ancient Church, put the requiſite neceſſity of Infant-Baptiſm out of Queſtion, becauſe the Church in the next Age unto the Apoſtles, practiced Infant-Baptiſm, as an Apoſtolical Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by conſequence, as an Inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In like manner, as the Intrinſecal Arguments taken rom the Style, Sanctity, Dignity, and Efficacy of the Holy Scriptures, and the perpetual Analogy, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the ſeveral Books contained in them, are by themſelves but probable, and no demonſtrative reaſons, that all the Books contained in the Canon, and no other, are the Word of God, but in conjunction with the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and Authority of the Ancient Catholick Church, amount to a Demonſtration: So, though the Texts which I have cited, are of themſelves but probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the requiſite neceſſity of Infant-Baptiſm, yet in concurrence with ſuch a Comment upon them, as the Practice of the next Age unto the Apoſtles, and all Ages ſince, from one Generation to another, they amount to ſuch a demonſtration, as is called in <hi>Logick, Demonſtratio ducens ad abſurdum,</hi> and are a violent Preſumption, that Children ought to be Baptized. I might run on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, as to the other Inſtances of Epiſcopal Government, the admitting of Women to the Communion, and the Obſervation of the Lord's day; and therefore let the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Infant-Baptiſm conſider well with themſelves, Whether rejecting of it after a Concurrence of ſuch Texts, and ſuch a Tradition to eſtabliſh it, they do not teach

            <p>Thus much I have ſaid concerning the <hi>requiſite neceſſity</hi> of Infant-Baptiſm, to ſhew that it is not lawful to ſeparate from a Church for appointing of Infants to be Baptized, when there are ſuch cogent reaſons ariſing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Scripture, and Antiquity, to preſume that Infant-Baptiſm was an Apoſtolical Tradition, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt. And I have deſignedly called it a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from an <hi>abſolute</hi> neceſſity, leſt the Reader ſhould think I were of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Opinion, who thought Baptiſm indiſpenſibly neceſſary to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Infants, ſo that a Child dying unbaptized, through the careleſneſs, or Superſtition of the Parents, or through their miſtaken Belief of the unlawfulneſs of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, were <note n="*" place="margin">Poteſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inde rectè dici parvulos ſine Baptiſmo de corpore exeuntes in damnatione omnium mitiſſimâ futuros.

            <p>No, I intended no ſuch ſevere Concluſion, (becauſe we ought not to tye God to the ſame means, to which he hath tied us) but only to ſhew that the Baptiſm of young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is antecedently neceſſary, and <note n="†" place="margin">Articles of Religion, <hi>Artic. 27.</hi>

And to ſet this way of arguing more home upon the Conſciences of thoſe, who Diſſent from the Church upon the account of Infant-Baptiſm, I appeal unto them, Whether Scripture, and Antiquity, ſtanding againſt Infant-Baptiſm in the ſame poſture of evidence, that they now ſtand for it, it would not be unjuſtifiable for any ſort of Men to ſeparate from the Church, for not Baptizing Infants, as they do now for Baptizing of them.</p>
            <p>Let us ſuppoſe, for Example, That the Diſciples of Chriſt, inſtead of rebuking thoſe, that brought little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52302:31"/>
unto him, had brought them to him themſelves; and he had been much diſpleaſed at them for it, and ſaid, <hi>I ſuffer not little Children to come unto me, for the Kingdom of God is not of ſuch:</hi> Let us put the caſe, That two Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts had recorded this ſuppoſed Story, and accordingly we had been aſſured, by the Writers of the two next Ages to the Apoſtles, that then there was no Baptizing of Infants, and that the Apoſtles Baptized them not, and that there never was any Church in after Ages which did practiſe Infant-Baptiſm: Upon this Suppoſition, I appeal unto them, Whether it would not be highly unreaſonable to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from all the Churches in the World, for not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Infant-Baptiſm againſt the Concurrence of ſuch a Text, to the contrary, and the ſence and practiſe of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>The caſe, which I ſuppoſe one way, is the real caſe the other, only with this difference, that the ſuppoſed caſe would have but the benefit of one Text, whereas the real hath the benefit of many in Conjunction with Tradition; and therefore, ſeeing there are ſo many Texts, and ſuch a cloud of Witneſſes for Infant-Baptiſm, Why ſhould it not be looked upon as one of the common Notions of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, like the <hi>Parallel Doctrines</hi> above-mentioned, though it be not commanded (eſpecially when, as I have ſhewed there was no need of commanding of it) in expreſs Words.</p>
            <p>I know the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of all ſorts, and eſpecially thoſe, for whoſe ſake I am now writing, are bred up in great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and ſiniſter Suſpicions againſt Tradition, declaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it, as very uncertain, and againſt the uſe of it as very derogatory to the ſufficiency of the Word of God. But as to the firſt part of their Objection againſt the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Tradition, I deſire them to take notice, that there is a certain, as well as an uncertain; an undoubted, as well, as a pretended Tradition, as there are true, certain, and undoubted, as well as pretended, and uncertain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that there are ſure ways whereby ingenious, and inquiſitive.

It was by Tradition in this ſence, that the Catholicks, or Orthodox defended themſelves in the fourth Century againſt the <hi>Arians,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Africk</hi> againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> defend themſelves, as to the Scripture-Canon, and many other things againſt the Innovations of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> And therefore, in anſwer to the Second part of their Objection againſt Tradition, as detracting from the Sufficiency of the Scriptures, I muſt remind them, that the Scriptures, whoſe ſufficiency we admire, as well as they, cannot be proved to be the Word of God without Tradition, and that though they are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, where they are underſtood to determine any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, yet to the right underſtanding, and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in many points, Tradition is as requiſite, as the <note n="*" place="margin">Lex currit cum praxi.</note> practice of the Courts is to underſtand the Books of the Law.</p>
            <p>This is ſo true, that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> themſelves cannot defend the Baptizing of ſuch grown Perſons, as were born, and bred in the Church merely from the Scriptures, in which the very Inſtitution of Baptiſm hath a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard unto Proſelytes, who from <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> would come over unto the Chriſtian Faith.

            <p>Queſt. IV. <hi>Whether it be a Duty incumbent upon Chriſtian Parents, to bring their Children unto Baptiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſtate this Queſtion aright, I muſt proceed in the ſame order, that I did upon the laſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In arguing from the bare lawfulneſs, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, From the neceſſity thereof.</p>
            <p>As to the lawfulneſs of it, I have already ſhewn upon the laſt Queſtion, That there is no neceſſity of having a Command, or Example for to juſtifie the practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Initiation; but it is ſufficient, that it is not forbidden to make it lawful, and allowable under the Goſpel. Nay, I have ſhewed upon the Second Queſtion, that of the two, there is more reaſon that Chriſtians ſhould have had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs command to leave off, or lay down the practice of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Initiation, becauſe it was commanded by God in Infant-Circumciſion, and approved by him in Infant-Baptiſm (which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church added to Infant-Circumciſion) under the Legal State. Commands are uſually given for the beginning of the practice of ſomething, which was never in practice before; but to juſtifie the continuation of an anciently inſtituted, or anciently received practice, it is ſufficient, that the Power, which inſtituted, or approved it, do not countermand, or forbid it: and this, as I have ſhewn, being the caſe of Infants-Initiation, the Initiation of them by Baptiſm under the Goſpel, muſt at leaſt be lawful and allowable, and if it be ſo, then Parents, and Pro-parents are bound in Conſcience to bring them unto Baptiſm in Obedience unto the Orders of the Church. For the Church is a Society of a People in Covenant with God, and in this Society, as in all others there are Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and in Inferiors, ſome that muſt Order, and ſome that muſt obſerve Orders, ſome that muſt Command, and ſome that muſt Obey; and therefore, if the Catholick Church, or any Member of it commands her Children to obſerve
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52302:33"/>
any lawful thing, they are bound by the Common-Laws of all Government, and by the Precepts in the Goſpel, which regard Eccleſiaſtical Order and Diſcipline, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her Commands. <hi>Obey them</hi> (ſaith the <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</note> Apoſtle) <hi>who have the Rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves unto them, for they watch for your Souls</hi> Accordingly we read that St. <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4.</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> as he went through the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities delivered the Chriſtians the Decrees, which the Apoſtles had made at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to keep; but I think, I need not ſpend more time in the Proof of a thing, which all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will grant me, for though they differ from us, as to the Subject of pure Eccleſiaſtical Power, yet they all agree, that there is ſuch a Power, and that all lawful Commands proceeding from it, ought to be Obey'd.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if Infants are not uncapable of Baptiſmal Initiation, as is proved under the firſt Queſtion, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it by Chriſt, as is proved under the Second; but on the contrary, there are very good Reaſons to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, that Chriſt at leaſt allowed them the benefit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Baptiſm, as well as grown Perſons: then the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of any Church to Baptize them muſt needs lay an Obligation of Obedience upon the Conſciences of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Pro-parents, who live within the Pale of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the matter of that Ordinance is a thing not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but at leaſt, allowed by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But becauſe People, when the are once ſatisfied with the lawfulneſs, are wont, eſpecially in Church-matters, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the expediency of their Superiors Commands, and to obey them with moſt Chearfulneſs, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they know they have good reaſons for what they ordain; therefore, leaſt any one whom perhaps I may have convinced of the bare lawfulneſs of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſhould doubt of the expediency of it, and upon that account be leſs ready to comply, I will here proceed to juſtifie the practice of the Church in this Particular; by ſhewing</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Baptiſmal-Initiation is very beneficial and profitable for Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52302:34"/>And Secondly, That the Baptizing of them condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth very much to the well-being and edification of the Church.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, Baptiſmal-Initiation is very beneficial and profitable for Infants, becauſe they are capable of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and Priviledges of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>This I ſhewed in general before, under the firſt Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and now I will ſhew it in a more particular manner of Induction, by inſiſting upon the ſeveral Ends, for which Baptiſm was ordained.</p>
            <p>Firſt then Baptiſm was ordained, That the Baptized Perſon might be thereby ſolemnly conſecrated unto God, and dedicated to his Service, and I hope I need not prove, that Children are capable of this benefit; ſince <hi>Jewiſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> were Conſecrated to God by Circumciſion; and the Scripture tells us, that <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Judges</hi> 13.15.</note> 
               <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a <hi>Nazarite</hi> from the Womb, and that <hi>Samuel</hi> from the time of his Weaning, was dedicated unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>Secondly Baptiſm was ordained, That the Baptized Perſon might be made a Member of Chriſt's Myſtical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is the Holy Catholick Church. This is a great, and honourable Priviledge, and no Man can deny, but <hi>Infants</hi> are as capable of it under the New, as they were under the Old Teſtament. Nay, ſo far are they from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under any Natural Incapacity, as to Church-Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that they are ordinarily born free of Kingdoms, Cities, and Companies; and therefore, why any Man ſhould think it not ſo proper for the Church-Chriſtian to be as indulgent to them, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was, and Civil Societies uſually are, I profeſs I cannot tell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly it was ordained, That the Baptized Perſon might by that Solemnity paſs from a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein he was a Child of Wrath, into a State of Adoption or Grace, wherein he becomes a Child of God.</p>
            <p>For by our Firſt Birth we are all Children of Wrath.</p>
            <p>But by our Second Birth in Baptiſm, we are made Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God: And why it ſhould be ſo improper for a Child to paſs in this ſolemn manner from one Spiritual, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52302:34"/>
well, as from one Temporal State to another, or be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Adopted by God, as well as Man, or</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Why a Child may not be Adopted under the Goſpel, as well, as under the Law? I am confident, thoſe who are willing to defer the Baptiſm of Infants, would be puzzled to give any rational account.</p>
            <p>In the Fourth place, Baptiſm was inſtituted for a Sign to Seal unto Baptized Perſons the pardon of their Sins, and to confer upon them a Right of Inheritance unto Everlaſting Life; but Baptiſm hath this Effect upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as well as upon adult Perſons, for it waſhes them clean from <note n="*" place="margin">De hoc etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I cannot deny, but they may be ſaved without Baptiſm, by the extraordinary, and uncovenanted Mercies of God, and ſo may actual Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who die unbaptized, if they did not contemn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; but then the hopes which we ought to have of Gods Mercy, in extraordinary Caſes, ought not to make us leſs regardful of his ſure, ordinary, and covenanted Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the appointed means, unto which they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed.</p>
            <p>But in the Fifth place, Baptiſm was ordained, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the Covenant, and ingrafted into Chriſt's

               <hi>Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Unction;</hi> and we need not doubt, but they talked, as they felt; and for this reaſon, they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized Infants, becauſe they knew that they acquired a Right unto the ſame Spirit by Baptiſm, who would be ſure to preſide, and watch over them, and act upon their Souls according to the meaſure of their capacity, and prevent them in their very firſt doings with his gracious helps.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, though it ſhould be granted, that the Holy Ghoſt cannot be actually conferred upon Infants in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,<note n="†" place="margin">Vid. Cypriani Ep. 1. ad Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum.</note> by reaſon of their natural incapacity (as <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> raſhly aſſert) yet the Baptizing of them is not fruſtrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as to this great End of Baptiſm, becauſe they thereby acquire an actual Antecedent Right to the Aſſiſtances, and Illuminations of the Holy Spirit, which they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as ſoon, and as faſt, as their natural incapacity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction betwixt having the Spirit, and having a Right unto the Spirit, holds not only in Infant-Baptiſm, but in the Baptiſm of Hypocrites, and ſecret Sinners, who by ſubmitting unto the Ordinances of Baptiſm acquire an actual Antecedent Right unto the Spirit, although they are in a moral incapacity of receiving the Graces of it, till their Hypocriſie is removed. Nevertheleſs, their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is not ineffectual as to this End, but is a means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Holy Ghoſt upon them without re-baptization, becauſe though they cannot receive it at the moment of their Baptiſm, by reaſon of their Hypocriſie, as ſincere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents do, in whom there is no ſuch Moral Impediment; yet by virtue of it, they will be ſure to receive it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as ſoon, as they ſhall in any degree become capable thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:52302:35"/>Thoſe are the Bleſſings, and Benefits, conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Baptiſm by God's appointment, of which Infants are as capable, as actual Believers, and let any Impartial Man judge, Whether it is more for their benefit, that this manifold capacity in them ſhould be actually anſwered by the timely Adminiſtration of Baptiſm, or that it ſhould lay void and unſatisfied, till they came to years of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion? Which is beſt for a Child that hath the <hi>Evil,</hi> to be Touched for it, while he is a Child, or to wait till he is of ſufficient Age to be ſenſible of the Benefit? Or to make one Compariſon more, which would be beſt for a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Child, to be preſently reſtored to his Blood, and and Eſtate, and his Princes Favour, or to be kept in a meer capacity of being reſtored till he was a Man?</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe Benefits which are conſequent upon Baptiſm by God's appointment, there is another no leſs profitable to young Children, which will juſtifie the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Infant-Initiation,</hi> and that is to have ſuch an early pre-engagement laid upon them, which without the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Baſeneſs can Ingratitude, they cannot afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. No Perſon of common Ingenuity, who hath any ſence of honour, or any tolerable degree of Conſcience within him, can without ſhame and horrour break thoſe Sacred Bonds aſunder, by which he was bound to God, in his Infancy, when he comes to Years of underſtanding; but on the contrary, will think himſelf in Honour, and Gratitude, bound to own, and ſtand to the Obligation, which he then contracted, when he was graciouſly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſo many Bleſſings and Privileges, before he could do any thing himſelf towards the obtaining of them, or underſtand his own good. It would argue a Perſon to be of a very ill nature, and untoward Diſpoſition to break ſuch ſolemn Foederal Vows, and therefore, we ſee that Children generally do readily take upon themſelves their Baptiſmal Obligations, when they come to the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whereas were they left alone, to their own Freedom, when they would be Baptized, they would be apt to put it off from time to time, through the averſneſs that the corrupt nature of Man hath to ſuch ſtrict, and Spiritual
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52302:36"/>
Engagements, and in ſuch a State of Liberty, as this, Men would need, as many, and as earneſt Exhortations unto Baptiſm, as unto the Lord's Supper; and in ſuch an Age, as ours is at leaſt, reluct as much to come unto that, as we ſee by experience they do unto this. Wherefore, upon Suppoſition that Chriſt doth but allow Children to be brought unto him in Baptiſm, The Wiſdom of the Church is highly to be applauded for bringing them under ſuch an early, and beneficial pre-engagement, and not leaving them to their own liberty at ſuch years, when Fleſh, and Blood, would be apt to find out ſo many Shifts, and Excuſes, and make them regret to be Baptized.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the Second place, as the Baptiſm of Infants is very Beneficial, and profitable unto them: So it conduceth very much to the well-being, and edification of the Church, in preventing thoſe Scandalous and Shameful delays of Baptiſm, which grown Perſons otherwiſe would be apt to make, putting of it off till the time of ſome great ſickneſs, as many were wont to do in the third and fourth Century, when being not Baptized in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, they did ordinarily receive. Baptiſm, as <hi>Papiſts</hi> now receive extream <hi>Unction,</hi> when they were ready to expire.</p>
            <p>For, as it is uſual now for Perſons to defer the receiving of the Lord's Supper, for fear of Damnation, miſtaking the Apoſtle, where he ſaith, <hi>He that Eateth and Drinketh unworthily, Eateth, and Drinketh Damnation to himſelf:</hi> So in thoſe Ages it was uſual for Perſons to defer their own, and their Childrens Baptiſm out of a <note n="*" place="margin">

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:52302:36"/>Now the Baptizing of Children being deferred by their Parents out of this Superſtitious fear, they, when they came to be Men and Women, put the doing of it off for ſeveral Reaſons, and Pretences, which we learn out of the Writers of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>Some deferred it out of Worldly Love, and a Carnal loathneſs to renounce their ſinful Pleaſures, and take upon them the Yoke of Chriſt. Some put it off pretending want of leiſure through multitude of worldly buſineſs; others out of lazineſs, and careleſs negligence. Others were wont to plead the inſufficiency of their knowledge,<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's</hi> Excellent Preface to his Treatiſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm.</note> others the inconveniency of the preſent time; others would not be Baptized, but at ſuch a time, or in ſuch a place, as ſuch a City, or ſuch a River, or by ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in ſuch a Company. Some would put it off upon a pretence of not having ſuch, or ſuch Relations preſent, others would decline it upon the account of ſome ſmall Expences, that attended it; others becauſe they relucted to confeſs their Sins, others becauſe they favoured not the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity, or to comply with the <hi>Arians;</hi> ſome becauſe they would imitate the Example of Chriſt, who was not Baptized till the 30th Year of his Age, and ſome out of fear of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>This happened formerly to the great ſhame, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the Chriſtian Religion, though the <note n="*" place="margin">Gregor. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianz. Greg. Nyſſ. <hi>and St.</hi> Baſil.</note> Fathers ſharply and vehemently Wrote, and Preached againſt it; and therefore, upon ſuppoſition of the bare lawfulneſs, or indifferency of Infant-Baptiſm, I cannot but approve the Wiſdom, and Prudence of thoſe Churches, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it, becauſe the practice of it doth prevent ſuch ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſcandalous Neglects of Baptiſm, which to the great prejudice of Chriſtianity, as Experience hath taught us, would otherwiſe ariſe in the Church.</p>
            <p>Thus much upon enquiry into the lawfulneſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of Infant-Baptiſm, to ſhew Chriſtian Parents what an indiſpenſable Obligation lies upon their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to bring their Children to be Baptized in Obedience to the Church, which hath appointed Infant-Baptiſm; but then if Infant-Baptiſm be not only neceſſary becauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52302:37"/>
the Church hath appointed it, but the Church hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it becauſe it is neceſſary, and in any wiſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then this Antecedent ſort of neceſſity doth yet lay a ſtronger Obligation upon the Conſciences of Parents to initiate their Children as being moſt agreeable to the practice of the Apoſtles, and the Intention, and Will of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt, As being moſt agreeable to the practice of the Apoſtles, who it is highly to be preſumed, authorized the practice of Infant-Baptiſm, becauſe, it was practiſed in the next Age unto them.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, As being moſt agreeable to the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Will of Chriſt, who it is to be preſumed would have forbidden, and countermanded the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> practice of initiating Infants, if he had not had a mind they ſhould be Baptized.</p>
            <p>Wherefore <note n="*" place="margin">Nam quum paedo-Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiâ Judaicâ in admiſſione Proſelytorum ita fuit notus, uſitatus, &amp; frequens, ut nihil ferè notius, uſitatius, &amp; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentius, non opus erat, ut aliquo praecepto roboraretur.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52302:37"/>
long after he departed, and we find the practice of it in the one, harmoniouſly anſwering to the practice of it in the other; and therefore what was before, and what was after this time, we may well preſume, was continued in the interim during the time of the Apoſtles, as his preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Will and Intention, who never did, or ſpoke any thing, that can reaſonably be interpreted, that he would have the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cuſtom of admitting <hi>Infants</hi> into the Church, laid aſide; and therefore, his ſilence, and the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Scriptures, are ſo far from being Arguments againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> that conſidering the Antecedent uſage of it, they are very ſtrong Preſumptions for it, as the Learned Author in the Margin foregoing doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently prove.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe alſo, have I diſcourſed above, upon the Second and Third Queſtions; and therefore if Chriſt in the Reformation of the Church, from the Law into the Goſpel, did not repeal the Ancient practice of <hi>Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> but left <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to be adminiſtred in the ſame Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as before his time, then it muſt needs be concluded, that there lies the ſame Obligation upon Parents (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting from the Commands of the Church) to deſire Baptiſm for their Children, as for grown Profelytes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it for themſelves.</p>
            <p>For what authority ſoever enacts any thing concerning Children, or Perſons under the years of diſcretion, doth lay at leaſt an implicite Obligation upon Parents, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parents to ſee that act be performed. As if for Example, an Act of Parliament ſhould be made, that all Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, Men, Women, and Children, ſhould pay ſo much an Head unto the King, the Act, by the nature of it, would oblige Parents, and Pro-parents, to pay for their Children, and the Minors in their cuſtody, as well as for themſelves. Or, if in the time of a general Contagion, the Supream Power ſhould command, that all Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, ſhould every Morning take ſuch an Antidote, that Command would oblige Parents to give it unto their Children, as well, as to take it themſelves. Juſt ſo the Ordinance of Baptiſm being intended, or inſtituted
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52302:38"/>
by our Saviour in its ancient Latitude for Children, as well, as grown Perſons, it muſt needs lay an Obligation upon Parents, and Pro-parents to bring them to the Holy Sacrrament, otherwiſe the Divine Inſtitution would in part be made void, and fruſtrated of the Ends for which it was inſtituted, as if it did not alſo lay an Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Adult Perſons to offer themſelves unto the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would be of no force at all.</p>
            <p>To ſum up all in ſhort. When our Lord firſt appointed Baptiſm, and afterwards ſaid, <hi>Go, and Proſelyte all Nations, Baptizing them,</hi> &amp;c. either he intended that Children ſhould be Baptized, as well as Grown Proſelytes, or he did not; if he did not intend they ſhould be Baptized, Why did he not plainly diſcover that Intention? Nay, Why did he not plainly forbid them to be Baptized, as they were wont to be, but if he intended they ſhould be Baptized according to the ancient cuſtom in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, Parents are as much bound to offer them unto Baptiſm, as Adult Believers, Men and Women, are bound to offer themſelves.</p>
            <p>What I have here ſaid about the Obligation, which lies upon Parents to bring their Children unto Baptiſm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all <hi>Pro-parents</hi> to whoſe care Children are committed, as <hi>Guardians, Tutors,</hi> and <hi>Church-Wardens;</hi> and leſt any ſhould ask, as ſome Sceptically do, at <hi>What time they are bound to bring them unto Baptiſm?</hi> As <hi>ſoon, as they are born, or the next day after, or when?</hi> I anſwer, by ſhewing the impertinency of that Queſtion, in reference to Grown Believers thus: <hi>When muſt a Believing Man, or Woman be Baptized? As ſoon as he Believes, or the next day after, or when?</hi> And truly the Anſwer is the ſame to both Queſtions, <hi>at any time,</hi> the Goſpel indulging a diſcretional Latitude in both Caſes, and only forbidding the wilful neglect of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and all unreaſonable, and needleſs delays thereof.</p>

            <p>Queſt. V. <hi>Whether it is lawful to Communicate with Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, who were only Baptized in their Infancy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtating of this, depends upon what I have ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Second, and Third Queſtions, to prove, <hi>That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are capable Subjects of Baptiſm, and that it is lawful to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:52302:38"/>
Baptize them;</hi> and if I have not erred, as I hope I have not, in thoſe two Determinations, then the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is lawful, and valid, and if the Baptiſm of them be lawful, and valid, then it cannot be unlawful to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with them, when they come to be Men, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, it never entred into the Heart of any of the ancient Chriſtians to refuſe Communion with grown Believers, who had been Baptized in their Infancy, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were Baptized in perfect health, as Children moſt commonly were, or only in danger of Death, as the Children of thoſe Novatian kind of Parents above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned always were, who were ſo far from thinking <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> a Nullity, or Corruption of Baptiſm, that they thought it neceſſary for them in caſe of apparent danger, and durſt not let them die unbaptized.</p>
            <p>Some others deferred the Baptizing of their Children, becauſe they thought them too weak to endure the Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Trine immerſion; and others, perhaps, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the private Opinion of <note n="a" place="margin">De Baptiſmo, c. 18.

               <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> thought is more convenient to delay the Baptizing of them till they were capable of being Catechized, between Three, and Four years old, but ſtill this delay of Baptiſm ſuppoſed their continuing in health, but in caſe of danger they thought it <note n="c" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> neceſſary to Baptize them, and if they ſurvived the danger, looked upon them as lawfully, and validly Baptized.</p>
            <p>Theſe were all the Pleas we read of for deferring the Baptiſm of Infants among the Ancients, who never urged this for one, that Infant-Baptiſm was unlawful, or invalid. No, They never argued againſt it from the want of thoſe pre-requiſite Conditions in Children, which Chriſt, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52302:39"/>
the Apoſtles required in Adult Proſelytes, nor from the want of Precept, and Example for it in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſo underſtood the Scriptures, as to think it as lawful, and warrantable as the Baptiſm of grown Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and neceſſary in caſe of danger; and juſt ſo did thoſe, who deferred their Baptiſm, for fear of ſinning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, think the Baptiſm of Men and Women only neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at the laſt extremity, in apparent danger of Death.</p>
            <p>But then if the ordinary practice of Infant-Baptiſm be not only lawful, and valid, but alſo neceſſary, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt agreeable to the preſumed Will of Chriſt, who did not countermand the practice of it, and moſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the practice of the Apoſtles, as can be proved from the practice of the very next Age unto them; then it muſt not only be lawful to Communicate with Believers, who were Baptized in their Infancy, but an exceeding great Sin, and Preſumption to refuſe Communion with them upon that account.</p>
            <p>In a word, If <hi>Infant-Baptiſm</hi> be not only lawful, but neceſſary, what a grievous, and provoking Sin, muſt it needs be, to diſown thoſe for Members of Chriſt's Body, whom he owns to be ſuch? But if it be neither, as <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> vainly pretend, then there hath not been a true Church upon the Face of the Earth, for Eleven hundred Years, nor a Church, for above Fifteen hundred, with which a true Chriſtian could Communicate without Sin.</p>
            <p>This is a very abſurd, and dreadful conſequence, and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the purity of the Apoſtolical Ages, while the Church was ſo full of Saints, Martyrs, and Miracles, and repreſented as <note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>More's</hi> Apocalypſis Apoc.

               <p>Furthermore, none of the four Teſtimonies for, <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> ſpeak of it, as of an <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi> doth of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> not to mention that the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> never owned the neceſſity of <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> as they did of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm:</hi> All which things conſidered, ſhew, that there is nothing near the like Evidence in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity for the practice of the one, as there is for that of the other.</p>
               <p>And as there is not the like evidence for the conſtant, ſucceſſive, and general practice of <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> that there is for <hi>Infant-Baptiſm:</hi> So there is not the like Reaſon for the practice of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe Baptiſm is the Sacrament, or <hi>Myſtery of Initiation,</hi> of which Perſons of all Ages are capable; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtituted chiefly for an initiatory Sign to ſolemnize the admiſſion of the Baptized Perſon into the Church, and to Seal all the Bleſſings of the Goſpel unto him, as a Member of Chriſt. This is the Subſtance, or Chief end of Baptiſm; which, as I have ſhewed upon the Second, and Fourth Queſtions, is equally anſwered in the Baptiſm of Children, as well as of profeſſing Believers; Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, as well as Confeſſion of Sins, being but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental Circumſtantials, which are neceſſary with reſpect to the State of the Perſon to be Baptized, but not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52302:40"/>
it ſelf. But on the contrary, the Holy Euchariſt, or Communion, is the <hi>Sacrament of Perfection,</hi> and Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Chriſtian Religion, being primarily, and chiefly inſtituted for a Sacrificial Feaſt in remembrance of Chriſt's Death, and Paſſion, which being an act of great Knowledge and Piety, Children are not capable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, There is not the like Reaſon for Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and Communicating Infants, becauſe that is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Authority of many Texts of Scripture, which without the Concurrence of Tradition are fairly, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuinely interpretable for it; but this is grounded only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one Text [<hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood ye have no life in you</hi>] which it is doubtful whether it is to be underſtood of the Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, or no, becauſe it cannot be underſtood of it but in a <hi>proleptical ſence,</hi> the Lord's Supper having not been yet inſtituted by him; or if it be to be ſo underſtood, yet the ſence of it ought to be regulated by the Chief end of its <hi>Inſtitution</hi> contained in thoſe words of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>do this in remembrance of me,</hi> and this do ye, <hi>as oft, as ye drink it in remembrance of me.</hi> Wherefore though this Text were literally to be underſtood of the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> firſt interprets it, yet it ought not to be ſtrained to <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> becauſe Infants cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Holy Banquet in <hi>remembrance of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore though the Cuſtom of <hi>Communicating Infants</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed by Degrees in ſome Ages of the Church, yet the Weſtern Churches diſcerning the miſtake upon which it was grounded, have long ſince laid it aſide, though they ſtill continue the practice of <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> as fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Chief end of Baptiſm, and as being founded upon more, and clearer Texts of Scriptures, and a much more noble Tradition, than <hi>Infant-Communion</hi> is.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, There is not the like reaſon for Baptizing, and Communicating Infants, becauſe the Correſpondent practice of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in <hi>Infant-Circumciſion,</hi> and <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> anſwered as a Pattern unto that under the Law, but there was nothing of a Pattern under it, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52302:41"/>
anſwered ſo to <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> becauſe a Child never partook of the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26, 27.</note> Paſsover, before he was old enough to take his Father by the hand, and to go up from the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> unto the Mount of the Temple, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire about the meaning of the Service, and was capable of underſtanding the nature of it, as it was done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in like manner when the Children of Chriſtians are old enough to be inſtructed in the nature of the Holy Communion, and to underſtand that, then they may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, be it as ſoon, as it will, if they are Baptized and Confirmed; though it is true, that Chriſtian Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are uſually much older, than the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> were, before they Communicate, which is merely accidental, becauſe it requires a riper reaſon to underſtand the Myſtery of the Holy Euchariſt, which is done in remembrance of our Spiritual Deliverance by the Sacrifice of Chriſt, both God and Man, upon the Croſs, than to underſtand the plain and eaſie meaning of the Paſsover, which was annually kept in remembrance of the Temporal Deliverance of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſpeak yet more fully of <hi>Infant-Communion,</hi> the practice of it is ſo far from prejudicing the Cauſe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,</hi> that it mightily confirms it, becauſe none were, or could be admitted to partake of the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, till they were validly <note n="*" place="margin">Theodoret. Therapeut. Serm. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Baptized, and therefore the practice of <hi>Infant-Communion</hi> is a moſt emphatical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that all the Churches, wherein it ever was, or <note n="a" place="margin">As in the <hi>Greek, Ruſſian,</hi> and <hi>Abyſſin</hi> Churches, and among the Chriſtians of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </note> ſtill is practiſed, were of Opinion that the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants</hi> was as lawful, and valid, as that of profeſſing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers can be.</p>
               <p>As for the Original of this cuſtom, it is not known when it began, probably it came in by degrees from the ancient, and laudable cuſtom of adminiſtring the Lord's Supper to grown Perſons preſently after their Baptiſm; and if ſo many of the ancient Churches were ſo tender towards <hi>Infants,</hi> as to bring them to the <hi>Communion,</hi> rather than deprive them of the leaſt ſhadow of right, what ſhall be ſaid in excuſe of thoſe uncharitable Men, who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52302:41"/>
will rather deſtroy all the Churches in the World, than bring their Children unto Baptiſm, of which they are capable, and to which they have a Right ſo highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not certain, and infallible, as I have proved above?</p>
               <p>The Second Objection againſt <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> which I took no notice of, but reſerved for this place, is taken <hi>from their incapacity to engage themſelves in Covenant unto God.</hi> For, ſay theſe Men, all who enter into <hi>Covenant,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Seal of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> muſt contract, and ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for their parts, as well as God doth for his, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Baptiſm which ſaveth us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3.21.</note> 
                  <hi>muſt have the anſwer, or reſtipulation of a good Conſcience towards God.</hi> But how can <hi>Infants</hi> reſtipulate, or what <hi>Conſcience</hi> can be in them, who have not the uſe of reaſon, nor are capable of knowing what the <hi>Covenant</hi> means?</p>
               <p>To this Objection, I anſwer as formerly, That it is as ſtrong againſt <hi>Infant-Circumciſion;</hi> as <hi>Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> for the <hi>Infants</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> were admitted as effectually into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and had it as really ſealed unto them, and were as ſtrongly tyed to perform the <hi>Conditions</hi> of it, when they came to years of <hi>underſtanding,</hi> as if they had been Circumciſed then, and at their Circumciſion had perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and expreſly <hi>indented</hi> with God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the ſame anſwer which will ſerve to juſtifie <hi>Infant-Circumciſion</hi> will juſtifie <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in the place of it, and it is this: That God of his goodneſs towards <hi>Infants</hi> was pleaſed to ſeal the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace unto <hi>Infants</hi> upon an <hi>implicite,</hi> and <hi>imputative</hi> ſort of Stipulation, which at years of underſtanding they were bound to own by openly profeſſing the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> or if they then renounced it, thereupon they became Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which in ſuch caſes was as void, as if it had never been made. An implicit Stipulation was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the Children of Believers, though an open Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Stipulation was required of Grown Proſelytes, which ſhews, that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was an inſtitution of <hi>Latitude,</hi> and that perſonal, and expreſs Reſtipulation was not a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral pre-requiſite condition to Circumciſion, but only to ſome Perſons to be Circumciſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:52302:42"/>In like manner Baptiſm being an <hi>inſtitution of Latitude,</hi> ordained for Perſons under, as well as at the years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, perſonal and expreſs Stipulation is only required of the former; and therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Text above cited likely had reſpect not to all Baptiſm, or Baptiſm in general, but only to the Baptiſm of Adult Proſelytes, whom the Miniſter uſed to <note n="*" place="margin">Hence <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian de Baptiſmo</hi> calls Baptiſm <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem Salutis.</hi> And in St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> we often read of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogation in Baptiſm.</note> interrogate at the time of Baptiſm, much after the ſame manner, as we interrogate Adult Proſelytes now.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, this Objection like the reſt which the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> make, runs upon this preſumption, that Baptiſm is a ſtrict inſtitution, and that perſonal and expreſs anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Reſtipulation is a pre-requiſite <hi>condition</hi> to all Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, whereas it is only a perſonal qualification required of Majors, or Adult Perſons, when they come to be Baptized.</p>
               <p>But as for Children, Baptiſm may be adminiſtred unto them upon an implicite, and imputative ſort of Reſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as Circumciſion was to the <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and Baptiſm now is to <hi>agonizing Chriſtian Infants,</hi> or elſe it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred unto them as Baptiſm formerly was among the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Minors</hi> of Proſelytes upon a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious</hi> Reſtipulation by their <hi>Sponſors,</hi> which ſeems to have been tranſlated together with the uſe of Baptiſm from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. It is certain, that <note n="*" place="margin">De Baptiſmo cap. 18. quid enim neceſſe eſt Sponſores etiam peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo ingeri?</note> 
                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> makes mention of <hi>Sponſors,</hi> or Sureties for Children at Baptiſm, and very probable, that the Apoſtles made <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>Major domos</hi> ſtipulate in the name of their <note n="†" place="margin">Praefecturae igitur juridicae quae Baptiſmo prae erat profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebatur Proſelytus ipſe Majorennis (Maſculus qui annum decimum tertium, foemina quae duodecim ſuperaverat) legem Moſaicam ſe ſervaturum.

Selden de Synedriis, Lib. 1. c. 3. <hi>And what is here ſaid of the CONSISTORY among the</hi> Jews, <hi>concerning the Baptiſm of Infants, and Minors, St.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſaith of the</hi> Church <hi>among Chriſtians,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodat illis mater Eccleſia aliorum pedes ut veniant, aliorum cor, ut credant, aliorum linguam ut fateantur.</note> 
                  <hi>Minors,</hi> when they Baptized them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to do; and upon this Suppoſition St. <hi>Peter</hi> in the Text above cited, might alſo probably allude to all Baptiſm, becauſe Grown
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52302:42"/>
Proſelytes to the <hi>Chriſtan Religion</hi> did anſwer for their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> as well as for themſelves at Baptiſm, according to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>Nay, there is little reaſon to doubt, but that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> being the Pattern of the <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm,</hi> the Apoſtles, and their Aſſiſtants who were <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Helleniſts,</hi> did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Cuſtom of <hi>Vicarious Stipulation</hi> at the Baptiſm of <hi>Infants,</hi> and <hi>Minors,</hi> as well as all the other Particulars, in which they reſemble one another, as the Picture doth the Face, whoſe Picture it is.</p>
               <p>As for Example, the <hi>Jewiſh Baptiſm</hi> was adminiſtred to Women, as well as Men, and ſo is the Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was never reiterated nor repeated, no more is the Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was called Regeneration, and a New Birth, and Baptized Perſons were ſaid to be born again and Regenerated, which alſo holds in Chriſtian Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Baptized Proſelytes among the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to leave their neareſt Relations, if it were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and adhere to the Church, and ſo are Baptized Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Proſelytes bound to do the ſame.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Infants of Proſelytes were Baptized among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as well as the Proſelytes themſelves, and ſo have I proved, that Infants have been always Baptized among the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>And therefore in the laſt place, ſince the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church Baptized Infants upon <hi>Vicarious Stipulation,</hi> why ſhould not we think it ſufficient for their entrance into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and that the Apoſtles did ſo too?</p>
               <p>Theſe things, and whatſoever elſe is written in this little Tract, I hope will be fairly, and candidly conſidered by the Diſſenters among us upon the account of <hi>Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> I ſay, the truth in Chriſt, I lye not, my <hi>Conſcience</hi> alſo bearing me Witneſs in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> who is the Searcher of Hearts, that I have great heavineſs, and almoſt

continual ſorrow in my heart for them, and that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them to the Church. I could wiſh in the Apoſtles Sence, that I my ſelf were an <hi>Anathema</hi> from Chriſt. And becauſe it is a Diſeaſe too common among Diſſenters, and more eſpecially among thoſe, with whom I have been a dealing, to have minds full of Prejudice, Prepoſſeſſion, and ſiniſter Suſpitions againſt what we Speak, or Preach, or Write, I have here ſubjoined a Letter of that Famous Martyr of Jeſus Chriſt Mr. <hi>John Philpot,</hi> concerning <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm,</hi> which I ſeriouſly recommend to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, and diligent peruſal, hoping that the ſame Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which may perhaps have leſs effect upon them as they come from me, may be better received, and make deeper impreſſion upon their Souls as they come from him, who like the Primitive Martyrs, was Bleſſed with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Viſions, and chearfully ſuffered for his Redeemer, who had ſuffered for him, and thanked God when the time was come, that he was to ſeal the truth of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion</hi> with his Blood.</p>

            <p>Being in the midſt of my ſweet reſt, it ſeemed to me to ſee a great beautiful City all of the colour of Azure, and white, four ſquare in a marvellous beautiful compoſition in the midſt of the Skie, the ſight whereof ſo inwardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me, that I am not able to expreſs the conſolation I had thereof, yea, the remembrance thereof cauſeth my Heart

as yet to leap for Joy: And as Charity is no Churle, but would have others to be Partakers of his delight, ſome thought I called to others (I cannot tell whom) and whilſt they came and we together beheld the ſame, by and by to my great Grief it vaded away.</p>
            <p>This Dream I think not to have come of the illuſion of the Senſes, becauſe it brought with it ſo much Spiritual Joy, and I take it to be of the working of God's Spirit for the contentation of your Requeſt, as he wrought in <hi>Peter</hi> to ſatisfie <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Therefore I Interpret this Beautiful City to be the Glorious Church of Chriſt, and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it in the Sky, ſignifieth the Heavenly State there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, whoſe Converſation is in Heaven, and that according to the Primitive Church, which is now in Heaven, Men ought to meaſure and judge the Church of Chriſt now in Earth; for as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Foundations thereof be in the Holy Hills, and glorious things be ſpoken of the City of God.</hi> And the marvellous quadrature of the ſame, I take to ſignifie the univerſal agreement in the ſame, and that all the Church here Militant ought to conſent to the Primitive Church throughout the four Parts of the World, as the Prophet affirmeth, ſaying; <hi>God maketh us to dwell after one manner in one Houſe.</hi> And that I conceived ſo wonderful Joy at the Contemplation thereof, I underſtand the unſpeakable Joy which they have that be at Unity with Chriſt's Primitive Church: For there is Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and Peace, which paſſeth all Underſtanding, as it is written in the Pſalms; <hi>As of Joyful Perſons is the dwelling of all them that be in thee.</hi> And that I called others to the fruition of this Viſion, and to behold this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful City, I conſtrue it by the Will of God this Viſion to have come upon me, muſing on your Letter, to the end, that under this Figure I might have occaſion to move you with many others, to behold the Primitive Church in all your Opinions concerning Faith, and to conform your ſelf in all points to the ſame, which is the Pillar and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of truth, and teacheth the true uſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and having with a greater fulneſs than we have now, the firſt fruits of the Holy Ghoſt, did declare the true

            <p>And ſince all truth was taught and revealed to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, which is our Mother, let us all that be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Children of God, ſubmit our ſelves to the judgment of the Church for the better underſtanding of the Articles of our Faith, and of the doubtful Sentences of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Let us not go about to ſhew in us, by following any private Man's Interpretation upon the Word, another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit than they of the Primitive Church had, leſt we deceive our ſelves. For there is but one Faith and one Spirit, which is not contrary to himſelf, neither otherwiſe now teacheth us than he did them. Therefore let us believe as they have taught us of the Scriptures, and be at peace with them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the true Catholick Church is at this day: And the God of Peace aſſuredly will be with us, and deliver us out of all our Worldly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Troubles and Miſeries, and make us Partakers of their Joy and Bliſs, through our Obedience to Faith with them.</p>
            <p>Therefore God commandeth us in <hi>Job,</hi> to ask of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Generation, and to ſearch diligently the memory of the Fathers. For we are but Yeſterdays Children,<note place="margin">

of a Viſion before God unfeigned.

            <p>Indeed if you look upon the Papiſtical Synagogue only, which hath corrupted God's Word by falſe Interpretations, and hath perverted the true uſe of Chriſt's Sacraments, you might ſeem to have good handfaſt of your Opinion againſt the Baptiſm of Infants. But foraſmuch as it is of more Antiquity, and hath his beginning from God's Word, and from the uſe of the Primitive Church, it muſt not in re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſpect of the abuſe in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Church be neglected, or thought not expedient to be uſed in Chriſt's Church. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> one of the <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

But the Catholick truth delivered unto us by the Scriptures, plainly determineth, that all ſuch are to be Baptized, as whom God acknowledgeth for his People, and vouchſafeth them worthy of Sanctification or Remiſſion of their Sin. Therefore ſince that Infants be in the number or ſcroll of God's People, and be Partakers of the Promiſe by their Purification in Chriſt, it muſt needs follow thereby, that they ought to be Baptized as well as thoſe that can Profeſs their Faith. For we judge the People of God as well by the free and liberal Promiſe of God, as by the Confeſſion of Faith. For to whomſoever God promiſeth himſelf to be their God, and whom he acknowledgeth for his, thoſe no Man without great Impeity may exclude from the number of the Faithful. But God promiſeth, that he will not only be the God of ſuch as do profeſs him, but alſo of Infants, promiſing them his Grace and Remiſſion of Sins, as it appeareth by the words of the Covenant made unto

Whereby we may gather that he receiveth them freely unto his Grace, although as yet they confeſs not their Faith. Since then that the Word of the Promiſe, which is contained in Baptiſm, pertaineth as well to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren as Men, why ſhould the ſign of the Promiſe, which is Baptiſm in Water, be withdrawn from Children, when Chriſt himſelf commandeth them to be received of us, and promiſeth the Reward of a Prophet to thoſe that receive ſuch a little Infant, as he for an Example did put before his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Now will I prove with manifeſt Arguments,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note> that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to be Baptized, and that the Apoſtles of Chriſt did Baptize Children.

            <p>

               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> And without all doubt the Apoſtles Baptized thoſe which Chriſt commanded: But he commanded the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be Baptized, among the which Infants be reckoned: The Apoſtles then Baptized Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> The Goſpel is more than Baptiſm, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid; <hi>The Lord ſent me to Preach the Goſpel, and not to Baptize:</hi> Not that he denied abſolutely that he was ſent to Baptize, but that he preferred Doctrine before Baptiſm, for the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded both to the Apoſtles: but Children be received by the Doctrine of the Goſpel of God, and not refuſed: Therefore what Perſon being of reaſon may deny them Baptiſm, which is a thing leſſer than the Goſpel? For in the Sacraments be two things to be conſidered, the thing ſignified, and the Sign, and thing ſignified is greater than the Sign, and from the thing ſignified in Baptiſm, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not excluded; who therefore may deny them the Sign, which is Baptiſm in Water?</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> could not deny them to be Baptized in Water, to whom he ſaw the Holy Ghoſt given, which is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sign of God's People:<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note> None be received into the Kingdom of Heaven, but ſuch as God loveth, and which are endued with his Spirit: For whoſo hath not the Spirit of God, he is none of his. But Infants be beloved of God, and therefore want not the Spirit of God: Wherefore if they have the Spirit of God as well as Men, if they be numbred among the People of God as well as we that be of Age, who (I pray you) may well withſtand Children to be Baptized with Water, in the Name of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles in times paſt being yet not ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, did murmur againſt thoſe which brought their Children unto the Lord, but the Lord rebuked them, and ſaid;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>Let the Babes come unto me.</hi> Why then do not theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> obey the Commandments of the Lord?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52302:46"/>
For what do they now a-days elſe that bring their Children to Baptiſm, than that they did in times paſt, which brought their Children to the Lord, and our Lord received them, and putting his hands on them, Bleſſed them, and both by Words and by Gentle Behaviour towards them, declared manifeſtly that Children be the People of God, and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of GOD? But ſome will ſay, Why then did not Chriſt Baptize them? Becauſe it is Written, Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Baptized not, but his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>Moreover,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>John</hi> 4.</note> Circumciſion in the Old Law was miniſtred to Infants; therefore Baptiſm ought to be miniſtred in the New Law unto Children. For Baptiſm is come in the ſtead of Circumciſion, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, ſaying to the <hi>Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.</note> By <hi>Chriſt ye are Circumciſed with a Circumciſion which is without hands, when ye put off the body of ſin of the Fleſh, by the Circumciſion of Chriſt, being buried together with him through Baptiſm.</hi> Behold, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth Baptiſm the Circumciſion of a Chriſtian Man, which is done without hands, not that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be miniſtred without hands, but that with hands no Man any longer ought to be Circumciſed, albeit the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Circumciſion do ſtill remain in Faithful People.</p>
            <p>To this I may add, That the Servants of God were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to miniſter the Sacraments to them, for whom they were inſtituted. As for an Example, we may behold <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſ.</hi> 2.</note> who moſt diligently procured the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be Circumciſed before they entred into the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but ſince the Apoſtles were the Preachers of the Word, and the very Faithful Servants of Jeſus Chriſt, who may hereafter doubt that they Baptized Infants, ſince Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is in place of Circumciſion?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> The Apoſtles did attemperate all their doings to the Shadows and Figures of the Old Teſtament: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is certain that they did attemperate Baptiſm accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to Circumciſion, and Baptized Children becauſe they were under the Figure of Baptiſm; for the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſed through the Red Sea, and the bottom of the Water of <hi>Jordan,</hi> with their Children. And although the Children be not always expreſſed, neither the Women in the Holy Scriptures, yet they are comprehended and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52302:47"/>Alſo the Scripture evidently telleth us, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles baptized whole Families or Houſholds: But the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be comprehended in a Family or Houſhold, as the chiefeſt and deareſt part thereof: Therefore we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Apoſtles did Baptize Infants or Children, and not only Men of lawful age. And that the Houſe or Houſhold is taken for Man, Woman, and Child, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the 17. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and alſo in that <hi>Joſeph</hi> doth call <hi>Jacob</hi> with all his Houſe, to come out of the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally, I can declare out of ancient Writers, that the Baptiſm of Infants hath continued from the Apoſtles time unto ours, neither that it was inſtituted by any Councels, neither of the Pope, nor of other Men, but commended from the Scripture by the Apoſtles themſelves. <hi>Origen</hi> upon the Declaration of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the 6. <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Church of Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Baptiſm from the very Apoſtles.</hi> St. <hi>Hierome</hi> maketh mention of the Baptiſm of Infants, in the 3. Book againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</note> and in his Epiſtle to <hi>Leta.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth for this purpoſe, a place out of <hi>John,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> in his 1. Book aganſt <hi>Julian,</hi> Chap. 2. and he again writing to St. <hi>Hierome</hi> Epiſt. 28. ſaith, <hi>That St.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian <hi>not making any new Decree, but firmly obſerving the Faith of the Church, judged with his fellow Biſhops, that as ſoon as one was born, he might be lawfully Baptized.</hi> The place of <hi>Cyprian</hi> is to be ſeen in his Epiſtle to <hi>Fidus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in writing againſt the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> in the 4. Book, Chap. 23. &amp; 24. ſaith, <hi>That the Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants was not derived from the authority of Man, neither of Councels, but from the Tradition or Doctrine of the Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyril</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus,</hi> Chap. 8. approveth the Baptiſm of Children, and condemneth the iteration of Baptiſm. Theſe Authorities of Men I do alledge, not to tie the Baptiſm of Children unto the Teſtimonies of Men, but to ſhew how Mens Teſtimonies do agree with God's Word, and that the verity of Antiquity is on our ſide, and that the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> have nothing but Lies for them, and new Imaginations, which feign the Baptiſm of Children to be the Pope's Commandment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:52302:47"/>After this will I anſwer to the ſum of your Arguments for the contrary. The firſt, which includeth all the reſt, is, It is Written, <hi>Go ye into all the World, and Preach the glad Tidings to all Creatures. He that believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be Saved: But he that believeth not ſhall be Damned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, That nothing is added to God's Word by Baptiſm of Children, as you pretend, but that is done which the ſame Word doth require, for that Children are accounted of Chriſt in the Goſpel among the number of ſuch as believe, as it appeareth by theſe words;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>He that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth one of theſe little Babes which believe in me, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to have a Milſtone tyed about his Neck, and to be caſt into the bottom of the Sea.</hi> Where plainly Chriſt calleth ſuch as be not able to confeſs their Faith, Believers; becauſe of his mere Grace he reputeth them for Believers. And this is no Wonder ſo to be taken, ſince God imputeth Faith for Righteouſneſs unto Men that be of riper Age: For both in Men and Children, Righteouſneſs, Acceptation, or Sanctification is of mere Grace and by Imputation, that the Glory of God's Grace might be praiſed.</p>
            <p>And that the Children of Faithful Parents are Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and among ſuch as do believe,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.</note> is apparent in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. And whereas you do gather by the order of the words in the ſaid Commandment of Chriſt, that Children ought to be taught before they be Baptized, and to this end you alledge many places out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> proving that ſuch as Confeſſed their Faith firſt, were Baptized after: I anſwer, That if the order of words might weigh any thing to this Cauſe, we have the Scripture that maketh as well for us. St. <hi>Mark</hi> we read, that <hi>John</hi> did Baptize in the Deſart,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark</hi> 1.</note> Preaching the Baptiſm of Repentance. In the which place we ſee Baptizing go before, and Preaching to follow after.</p>
            <p>And alſo I will declare this place of <hi>Matthew</hi> exactly conſidered, to make for the uſe of Baptiſm in Children, for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it written in this wiſe;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>All Power is given me</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going forth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, <hi>Diſciple ye,</hi> (as I may expreſs the ſignification of the Word;) that is, make or gather to me Diſciples of all Nations. And following, he
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52302:48"/>
declareth the way how they ſhould gather to him Diſciples out of all Nations, <hi>baptizing them and teaching;</hi> by bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and teaching ye ſhall procure a Church to me. And both theſe aptly and briefly ſeverally he ſetteth forth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have commanded you.</hi> Now then Baptiſm goeth before Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But hereby I do not gather; that the Gentiles which never heard any thing before of God, and of the Son of God, and of the Holy Ghoſt, ought to be Baptized, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would permit themſelves to be Baptized before they knew to what end. But this I have declared to ſhew you upon how feeble Foundation the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And plainly it is not true which they imagine of this Text, that the Lord did only command ſuch to be Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, whom the Apoſtles had firſt of all taught. Neither here verily is ſignified who only be to be Baptized, but he ſpeaketh of ſuch as be of perfect age, and of the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Faith, and of the Church to be planted among the Gentiles, which were as yet rude and ignorant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Such as be of Age may hear, believe, and confeſs, that which is Preached and taught, but ſo cannot Infants; therefore we may juſtly collect, that he ſpeaketh here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Infants or Children. But for all this they be not to be excluded from Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>It is a general rule; <hi>He that doth not Labour, muſt not Eat.</hi> But who is ſo barbarous that might think hereby, that Children ſhould be Famiſhed?</p>
            <p>The Lord ſent his Apoſtles at the beginning of the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up his true Religion unto all Nations, unto ſuch as were both ignorant of God, and were out of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God; and truly ſuch Perſons it behoved not firſt to be taught, and after baptized. If at this day we ſhould go to the <hi>Turks</hi> to Convert them to the Faith of Chriſt, verily firſt we ought to teach them, and afterward Baptize ſuch as would yield to be the Servants of Chriſt. Likewiſe the Lord himſelf in times paſt did, when firſt he renewed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52302:48"/>
the Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ordained Circumciſion to be a Seal of the Covenant after that <hi>Abraham</hi> was Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. But he, when he perceived the Infants alſo to pertain to the Covenant, and that Circumciſion was the ſealing up of the Covenant, did not only Circumciſe <hi>Iſmael</hi> his Son that was 13 years of Age, but all other Infants that were born in his Houſe, among whom we reckon <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even ſo Faithful People which were Converted from Heathen Idolatry by the Preaching of the Goſpel, and Confeſſing the Faith, were Baptized; when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their Children to be counted among the People of GOD, and that Baptiſm was the Token of the People of GOD, they procured alſo their Children to be baptized. Therefore as it is written; Abraham <hi>Circumciſed all the Male Children of his Houſe.</hi> Semblably we read in the Acts and Writings of the Apoſtles, that after the Maſter of the Houſe was turned to the Faith, all the whole Houſe was baptized. And as concerning thoſe which of old time were compelled to Confeſs their Faith before they received Baptiſm, which were called <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> they were ſuch as with our Fore-Fathers came from the Gentiles to the Church, who being yet rude of Faith, they did inſtruct in the Principles of their Belief, and afterward they did Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them; but the ſame Ancient Fathers notwithſtanding did Baptize the Children of Faithful Men, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready partly declared.</p>
            <p>And becauſe you do require a haſty anſwer of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of one that is but a dull Writer, I am here enforced to ceaſe particularly to go through your Letter in anſwering thereto, knowing that I have fully anſwered every part thereof, in that I have already written, although not in ſuch order as it had been meet, and as I purpoſed.
